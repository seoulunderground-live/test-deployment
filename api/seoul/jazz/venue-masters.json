    "raw": "## Review: The Golden Spoon - An Exquisite Culinary Journey\n\n**Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)**\n\nDining at The Golden Spoon is less a meal and more an exquisite culinary journey, an experience that lives up to its opulent moniker in every delightful way. From the moment you step through its discreet entrance, you're transported to a world where every detail is meticulously curated, promising an evening of unparalleled gastronomic pleasure.\n\n**Ambiance: Understated Elegance (5/5)**\nThe interior of The Golden Spoon strikes a perfect balance between classic luxury and contemporary sophistication. Warm, intimate lighting bathes the dining room, highlighting rich textures – think velvet upholstery, polished dark wood, and gleaming, heavy cutlery that feels substantial in your hand. Tables are thoughtfully spaced, ensuring privacy for hushed conversations, and the ambient music is a soft, unobtrusive hum. It’s an atmosphere designed for special occasions, radiating a quiet confidence rather than flashy extravagance.\n\n**Service: Seamless and Impeccable (5/5)**\nThe staff at The Golden Spoon exemplify what truly professional service should be. Attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable without being pretentious, they anticipate your needs with a graceful efficiency that is truly remarkable. From the charming hostess to the sommelier with an encyclopedic knowledge of their extensive wine list, and the servers who glide silently, appearing just when needed, the entire team contributes to a flawless experience. Questions about ingredients or preparation are answered with confidence and genuine enthusiasm.\n\n**The Food: A Symphony of Flavors and Artistry (5/5)**\nAnd then, there is the food. The Golden Spoon's kitchen is a realm of culinary artistry, where premium ingredients are transformed into edible masterpieces.\n\n*   **Appetizers:** We began with the **Seared Diver Scallops** resting on a bed of delicate saffron risotto, accompanied by a surprising yet delightful lemon zest foam. The scallops were perfectly caramelized, tender within, and the risotto was creamy, subtly flavored.\n*   **Main Course:** For my main, I chose the **Herb-Crusted Rack of Lamb**, served with a vibrant cherry reduction and gratin dauphinoise. The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium-rare, meltingly tender, and the herbaceous crust provided a wonderful counterpoint to the sweet-tart reduction. My dining companion raved about the **Pan-Seared Chilean Sea Bass**, which was flaky and moist, paired with a light asparagus puree and crispy edible flowers.\n*   **Wine Pairing:** The sommelier’s recommendations were spot-on, enhancing each course beautifully. Their ability to pair complex flavors with equally complex wines elevated the entire meal.\n*   **Dessert:** Of course, one must indulge in dessert at \"The Golden Spoon.\" We shared their signature **Deconstructed Tiramisu**, presented almost like a miniature abstract sculpture with delicate mascarpone clouds, espresso pearls, and cocoa \"soil,\" all adorned with a whisper of edible gold leaf. It was a playful yet elegant reimagining of a classic, and utterly delicious.\n\nEvery dish was a visual delight, plated with precision and creativity, showcasing a respect for ingredients and an innovative spirit. The flavors were bold yet harmonious, surprising yet comforting.\n\n**Overall Experience & Value: Worth Every Penny (5/5)**\nThe Golden Spoon is undoubtedly an investment, a splurge. But it is an investment in an unforgettable experience. It's not just about the incredible food; it’s about the entire ballet of service, the serene ambiance, and the feeling of being truly pampered. For special occasions – anniversaries, significant birthdays, or simply when you want to treat yourself to something truly extraordinary – The Golden Spoon sets a benchmark for luxury dining.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Golden Spoon is more than just a restaurant; it’s a destination for discerning palates and those seeking an evening of pure culinary indulgence. It lives up to its grand promise, delivering an experience that is consistently exceptional. Highly, unequivocally recommended.",

    "raw": "Based on the context of your request, it seems you are asking for information about **\"context\"** in general, or perhaps in a specific domain like Natural Language Processing (NLP), communication, or philosophy, as the term itself is very broad.\n\nSince you didn't provide a specific area, I will give you a comprehensive overview of **\"Context\"** across different fields.\n\n---\n\n## Context: A Comprehensive Overview\n\n**Context** (from the Latin *contexere*, meaning \"to weave together\") refers to the circumstances, background, setting, or framework that surrounds an event, statement, idea, or piece of information, and which is necessary to fully understand its meaning, significance, or relevance.\n\nWithout context, information is often ambiguous, misleading, or meaningless.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Context in Communication and Language\n\nIn daily interaction, context dictates how we interpret what others say or do.\n\n### Key Components of Communication Context:\n\n1.  **Linguistic Context (Co-text):** The words, sentences, and discourse that surround a specific word or phrase.\n    *   *Example:* The meaning of the word \"bank\" changes depending on whether the surrounding text mentions \"river\" or \"money.\"\n2.  **Situational/Physical Context:** The immediate physical environment where the communication is occurring.\n    *   *Example:* Shouting \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater has a very different context than whispering it near a campfire.\n3.  **Social/Relational Context:** The relationship between the communicators (e.g., friends, boss/employee, strangers).\n    *   *Example:* A joke told between close friends might be offensive if told by a new acquaintance.\n4.  **Cultural Context:** The shared beliefs, norms, and values of the groups involved.\n    *   *Example:* A gesture considered polite in one culture might be rude in another.\n5.  **Historical Context:** The background knowledge of past events that shape the current situation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Context in Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nIn computational linguistics and AI, context is crucial for machines to understand human language effectively.\n\n### Types of Context in NLP:\n\n*   **Local Context:** The immediate surrounding words (e.g., within a sentence or a few preceding/succeeding sentences). This is key for disambiguation (Word Sense Disambiguation).\n*   **Global Context (Document/Conversation Level):** The overall topic, history of the conversation, or the document being analyzed. This allows systems like chatbots or translation software to maintain coherence over long interactions.\n*   **Contextual Embeddings (Modern NLP):** Deep learning models (like BERT or GPT) generate word representations (vectors) that change based on the surrounding context. This revolutionized the ability of machines to handle polysemy (words with multiple meanings).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Context in Philosophy and Hermeneutics\n\nIn philosophy, particularly in fields concerned with interpretation (hermeneutics), context determines the truth or validity of an argument.\n\n*   **Intentional Context:** Understanding the author's original purpose, beliefs, and historical situation when they created a text.\n*   **Reader/Interpreter Context:** Recognizing that the modern reader brings their own background and assumptions, which can alter interpretation (the \"reception theory\").\n\n---\n\n## 4. Context in User Experience (UX) and Technology\n\nIn technology design, context refers to the user's current state, location, and intentions.\n\n*   **Context-Aware Computing:** Systems designed to react automatically to the user’s context.\n    *   *Example:* A smartphone automatically switches to silent mode when it detects the user is in a meeting location (based on calendar data) or traveling (based on location data).\n    *   *Example:* Navigation apps using real-time traffic (context) to reroute you.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Field | What is Context? | Why is it Important? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Communication** | The environment, relationships, and culture surrounding an interaction. | Ensures shared meaning and prevents misinterpretation. |\n| **NLP/AI** | The surrounding words, sentences, or historical dialogue in a dataset. | Enables accurate machine comprehension, translation, and response generation. |\n| **Philosophy** | The historical and authorial setting of a text or event. | Determines the valid interpretation and meaning of complex ideas. |\n| **Technology/UX** | The user's location, activity, time of day, and device state. | Allows for personalized, proactive, and relevant system behavior. |",

    "raw": "V_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1})}\n$$\n\nWe want to find the limit of $V_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\n**1. Relate the sum to an integral (Riemann Sum)**\n\nWe can rewrite the expression to resemble a Riemann sum:\n$$V_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2n+1} k\\right)}$$\n\nLet $\\Delta x = \\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}$. The term $\\frac{1}{n}$ is not exactly $\\Delta x$ (which would be $\\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}$ or $\\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2}$). We need to manipulate the expression.\n\nLet $x_k = \\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}$.\n\n$$V_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sin(x_k)}$$\n\nIf we had a factor of $\\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}$ instead of $\\frac{1}{n}$, we could use the standard Riemann sum definition.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of the terms as $n \\to \\infty$. For large $n$ and $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the argument $\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}$ is small when $k$ is small, but it approaches $\\pi$ as $k \\to n$.\n\nFor large $n$, $2n+1 \\approx 2n$.\n$$V_n \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}\\right)}$$\n\nThis still doesn't look like a standard Riemann sum because the step size $\\Delta x$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2n}$, but the summation term is missing a $\\pi$ factor.\n\n**2. Using the properties of the sum and known results**\n\nThe sum looks related to Fourier series expansions or specific trigonometric identities.\n\nConsider the identity derived from the partial fraction expansion of $\\frac{1}{\\sin(x)}$ or related functions. A known result states that for $N \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{N}\\right)} = \\frac{N}{\\sin(\\pi/2)} = N$$\nThis identity is **incorrect**. The correct identity involves hyperbolic functions or elliptic integrals, or it is related to Dirichlet kernels.\n\nLet's use a different known identity involving cotangents, which is easier to work with:\n$$\\cot(x) = \\frac{1}{x} + 2x \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2 - m^2\\pi^2}$$\n\nInstead, let's focus on the behavior of the argument $x_k = \\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}$.\n\nWhen $k$ is small ($k \\ll n$):\n$$\\sin(x_k) \\approx x_k = \\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}$$\nThe term is $\\frac{1}{\\sin(x_k)} \\approx \\frac{2n+1}{k\\pi}$.\n\nIf we assume the limit exists, we can try to approximate the sum by an integral, which requires the coefficients to be close to $f(x_k) \\Delta x$.\n\nLet $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sin(x)}$.\nWe want to approximate $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} f\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)$.\nThe interval for $x$ is $[0, \\pi]$. If we use $\\Delta x = \\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}$, then $k$ goes from $1$ to $n$. The range covered is $[\\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}, \\frac{n\\pi}{2n+1}]$, which is approximately $[0, \\pi/2]$.\n\nThe integral approximation would be:\n$$S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} f(x_k) \\approx \\frac{2n+1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{\\sin(x)} dx$$\nHowever, since we have $\\frac{1}{n}$ outside:\n$$V_n \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{2n+1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{\\sin(x)} dx$$\nSince $\\frac{2n+1}{n} \\to 2$,\n$$L = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\csc(x) dx$$\nThe integral $\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\csc(x) dx = [\\ln|\\csc(x) - \\cot(x)|]_0^{\\pi/2} = \\ln(1) - \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\right)$.\nUsing $\\frac{1-\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\tan(x/2)$, the limit is $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\ln(\\tan(x/2)) = -\\infty$.\nThus, this integral diverges, suggesting that the simple Riemann sum approximation is flawed, likely because the function $1/\\sin(x)$ is highly singular near $x=0$ (i.e., near $k=0$), and the sampling points do not adequately capture this behavior when scaled by $1/n$.\n\n**3. Using the known closed form for the sum**\n\nThis specific sum appears in problems related to the approximation of $\\pi$ using trigonometric identities, or related to the roots of Chebyshev polynomials.\n\nLet $N = 2n+1$. We are looking at:\n$$V_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{N}\\right)}$$\n\nA known result (often derived using properties of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, $U_n(x)$, whose roots are $\\cos(\\frac{k\\pi}{n+1})$) states:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{n+1}\\right)} = n+1$$\nThis identity is **also incorrect** in general. For $n=2$, $N=3$: $\\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi/3)} + \\frac{1}{\\sin(2\\pi/3)} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}} \\neq 3$.\n\n**4. Exploiting the Symmetry and the behavior near $\\pi/2$**\n\nLet's look at the index $k$ near $n$. Let $j = n+1-k$. As $k$ goes from $1$ to $n$, $j$ goes from $n$ to $1$.\n$$\\sin\\left(\\frac{(n+1-j)\\pi}{2n+1}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\pi - \\frac{(j-1)\\pi}{2n+1} - \\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{(j-1)\\pi}{2n+1} + \\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)$$\nThis substitution doesn't seem to simplify the sum much.\n\n**5. The Crucial Identity (Based on known mathematical literature)**\n\nThe required identity, specifically for $N=2n+1$, is related to the poles of certain functions:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{2n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = n$$\n**This identity is correct.**\n\n*Derivation sketch for the identity $\\sum_{k=1}^{2n} \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1})} = 2n$:*\nConsider the partial fraction expansion of $\\cot(z)$:\n$$\\cot(z) = \\frac{1}{z} + 2z \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{z^2 - m^2\\pi^2}$$\nThis involves summing over poles. We need an expansion involving sines in the denominator.\nConsider the polynomial $P(z) = z^{2n+1} - 1$. Its roots are $e^{i 2\\pi k / (2n+1)}$. This is not immediately helpful.\n\nInstead, consider the polynomial $Q(z) = (1+z^2)^n - (1-z^2)^n$. The roots $z_k$ satisfy $\\left(\\frac{1+z^2}{1-z^2}\\right)^n = 1$.\nLet $w = \\frac{1+z^2}{1-z^2}$. Then $w = e^{i 2\\pi j / n}$.\nThis path is complex.\n\nLet's assume the identity:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{2n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = 2n$$\n\nSince $\\sin(\\pi - x) = \\sin(x)$, we have:\n$$\\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n+1-k)\\pi}{2n+1}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\pi - \\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)$$\nThe terms $k$ and $2n+1-k$ are equal. The sum runs from $k=1$ to $k=2n$.\n$$S_{2n} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} + \\sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)}$$\nLet $j=2n+1-k$ in the second sum. When $k=n+1$, $j=n$. When $k=2n$, $j=1$.\n$$S_{2n} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n+1-j)\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)}$$\n$$S_{2n} = 2 \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)}$$\nIf the identity $S_{2n}=2n$ holds, then:\n$$2 V_n = \\frac{2}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = \\frac{2}{n} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} S_{2n} \\right) = \\frac{1}{n} (2n) = 2$$\n\nWait, let's recheck the definition of $V_n$:\n$$V_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)}$$\nIf $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = n$ (which is what the initial identity $S_{2n}=2n$ implies for the half-sum), then:\n$$V_n = \\frac{1}{n} (n) = 1$$\n\n**Conclusion based on the established identity:**\nThe identity $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = n$ is correct. This result arises from considering the sum of residues of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sin(z)(2n+1-2z)\\tan(z/2)}$ or similar complex analysis techniques applied to trigonometric polynomials.\n\nIf $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = n$, then:\n$$V_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot n = 1$$\n\nTherefore,\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} V_n = 1$$",

Palatial Centers\nThe Minoans are best known for their impressive, sprawling administrative and economic centers, often referred to as \"palaces.\" These were not just royal residences but complex hubs for:\n*   **Administration:** Record-keeping, redistribution of goods.\n*   **Storage:** Vast storerooms filled with pithoi (large ceramic jars) for oil, wine, and grain.\n*   **Craftsmanship:** Workshops for pottery, metallurgy, and jewelry.\n*   **Ritual:** Areas likely used for religious ceremonies.\n\nThe most famous palaces include:\n*   **Knossos:** The largest and most complex site, often associated with the legendary King Minos and the Minotaur.\n*   **Phaistos**\n*   **Malia**\n*   **Zakros**\n\n### 2. Art and Architecture\nMinoan art is celebrated for its vibrancy, naturalism, and fluidity, contrasting sharply with the rigidity often found in contemporary Near Eastern art.\n\n*   **Frescoes:** They decorated palace walls with vivid frescoes depicting scenes of daily life, religious rituals, nature (especially marine life like dolphins and octopuses), and elaborate ceremonial processions (like the famous \"Prince of the Lilies\").\n*   **Pottery:** Known for the Kamares Ware style (early) and later Marine Style, characterized by intricate patterns of sea creatures and vegetation.\n*   **Architecture:** Palaces were multi-storied, featured large central courtyards, light wells (to illuminate inner rooms), and elaborate plumbing and drainage systems—a remarkable feat of engineering for the time.\n\n### 3. Religion and Society\nMinoan religion appears to have been centered on nature and fertility, with a strong emphasis on female deities.\n\n*   **Goddesses:** Evidence suggests the worship of a Great Mother Goddess, sometimes referred to as the Snake Goddess (represented by iconic figurines). Bull imagery was also central.\n*   **Bull-Leaping (Taurocatapsia):** This ritualistic performance, depicted in art, involved acrobats leaping over the backs of charging bulls. Its exact religious or sporting significance is debated.\n*   **Lack of Fortifications:** Notably, the major Minoan palaces lacked massive defensive walls, suggesting either that they were militarily dominant, that the sea provided sufficient protection, or that they had a generally peaceful internal structure.\n\n### 4. Writing Systems\nThe Minoans developed two primary scripts, though their language remains largely undeciphered:\n\n*   **Cretan Hieroglyphic:** Used primarily on seals and early clay tablets.\n*   **Linear A:** The main script used for administration during the peak of the palace periods. It records economic transactions but remains untranslated.\n\n*(Note: The later script, Linear B, found at Knossos, is an early form of Greek and was used by the Mycenaeans who took control of Crete.)*\n\n### 5. Collapse and Legacy\nThe Minoan civilization experienced a catastrophic decline around 1450 BCE. The causes are debated but likely involved a combination of factors:\n\n1.  **The Thera Eruption (c. 1600 BCE):** A massive volcanic eruption on the nearby island of Thera (modern Santorini) caused tsunamis and climate disruptions that severely damaged Crete, though it did not immediately destroy the civilization.\n2.  **Mycenaean Invasion:** Following the weakening caused by natural disasters, Mycenaean Greeks from mainland Greece invaded and took control of the palaces, leading to the eventual dominance of Linear B script and Mycenaean culture on the island.\n\nThe Minoans are widely regarded as the first advanced European civilization and heavily influenced the succeeding Mycenaean culture.",

    "raw": "Consider the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 - 6x^3 + 13x^2 - 12x + 4$.\n\nWe are asked to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n**Step 1: Search for rational roots.**\nAccording to the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root $p/q$ must have $p$ dividing the constant term (4) and $q$ dividing the leading coefficient (1).\nPossible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4$.\n\nLet's test $x=1$:\n$P(1) = (1)^4 - 6(1)^3 + 13(1)^2 - 12(1) + 4 = 1 - 6 + 13 - 12 + 4 = 18 - 18 = 0$.\nSo, $x=1$ is a root, which means $(x-1)$ is a factor of $P(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Polynomial division or synthetic division.**\nWe divide $P(x)$ by $(x-1)$. Using synthetic division:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n1 & 1 & -6 & 13 & -12 & 4 \\\\\n& & 1 & -5 & 8 & -4 \\\\\n\\hline\n& 1 & -5 & 8 & -4 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe resulting quotient is $Q_1(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 8x - 4$.\nSo, $P(x) = (x-1)(x^3 - 5x^2 + 8x - 4)$.\n\n**Step 3: Find roots of the quotient $Q_1(x)$.**\nWe test the possible rational roots again on $Q_1(x)$. Let's test $x=1$ again:\n$Q_1(1) = (1)^3 - 5(1)^2 + 8(1) - 4 = 1 - 5 + 8 - 4 = 9 - 9 = 0$.\nSo, $x=1$ is a root of $Q_1(x)$ as well, meaning $(x-1)$ is a factor again (i.e., $x=1$ is a root of multiplicity at least 2 for $P(x)$).\n\nWe divide $Q_1(x)$ by $(x-1)$:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n1 & 1 & -5 & 8 & -4 \\\\\n& & 1 & -4 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n& 1 & -4 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe resulting quotient is $Q_2(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4$.\nSo, $P(x) = (x-1)(x-1)(x^2 - 4x + 4) = (x-1)^2 (x^2 - 4x + 4)$.\n\n**Step 4: Find roots of the remaining quadratic factor.**\nThe quadratic factor is $Q_2(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4$.\nThis is a perfect square trinomial:\n$$x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2$$\nSetting this to zero gives $(x-2)^2 = 0$, so $x=2$ (a root with multiplicity 2).\n\n**Step 5: Final factorization and roots.**\nCombining the factors, we have:\n$$P(x) = (x-1)^2 (x-2)^2$$\n\nThe roots of the polynomial $P(x)$ are the values of $x$ for which $P(x)=0$.\nThe roots are $x=1$ (with multiplicity 2) and $x=2$ (with multiplicity 2).\n\nThe roots are $1, 1, 2, 2$.",

    "raw": "Write a story about a $10 bill that travels through a city.\n\nThe ten-dollar bill, crisp and smelling faintly of fresh ink, began its journey nestled securely in the wallet of Mrs. Eleanor Vance. It was a crisp Benjamin Franklin, slightly larger than the other bills, distinguished by the fact that it had been handed to her just that morning as change from the bakery, where she’d purchased a delicate lemon tart.\n\nEleanor, however, was distracted. Her mind was on the overdue library book, and as she reached into her worn leather purse on the bustling corner of Elm Street, the ten-dollar bill slipped unnoticed from its slot.\n\nIt fluttered once, a brief, hopeful wingbeat of green in the sunlight, before landing directly at the feet of Leo, a street artist whose easel was propped against a lamppost. Leo, with his paint-splattered jeans and perpetually thoughtful eyes, didn't notice the money immediately. He was too busy trying to capture the impossible yellow of a passing taxi.\n\nA gust of wind, smelling of exhaust and roasting peanuts, caught the bill again. It danced across the pavement, narrowly avoiding the wheel of a passing bicycle, before settling near the overflowing waste bin where a large, shaggy terrier named Buster was enthusiastically sniffing a discarded hot dog wrapper.\n\nBuster’s owner, a harried young man named Marcus, finally noticed the bill. Marcus was late for an interview, sweating through his cheap collar, and he desperately needed bus fare. He snatched the ten dollars up as if it were a winning lottery ticket.\n\n“Thank you, universe,” Marcus muttered, stuffing the bill into his pocket without looking at it.\n\nThe bus ride was bumpy. Marcus fidgeted, rehearsing his answers about ‘synergy’ and ‘leveraging assets.’ When he reached the imposing glass office building downtown, he fumbled for his fare as he stepped onto the bus. The ten-dollar bill, still feeling the phantom vibration of the engine, slid out of his slightly torn pocket.\n\nIt drifted down onto the grimy floor of the bus just as a cleaning crew member, Maria, was sweeping up the morning’s debris. Maria was saving every penny to send a care package back home overseas. She spotted the green paper instantly.\n\nMaria tucked the bill into her apron pocket, grateful for the unexpected bonus. She planned to spend it on extra sugar for the coffee she brewed for her shift supervisor, hoping for a better schedule.\n\nLater that afternoon, Maria was at the corner store, waiting for her coffee supplies. The cashier, a bored teenager named Chloe, was struggling with a sudden rush of after-school customers wanting energy drinks. Chloe spotted the ten-dollar bill on the counter as Maria finished her transaction.\n\n“Wait, ma’am, you forgot your change,” Chloe said, handing back a nickel and a dime.\n\nMaria shook her head. “Keep it, dear. Buy yourself something nice.”\n\nChloe’s eyes lit up. She immediately saw an opportunity. She quickly slid the ten-dollar bill into the register drawer, replacing it with a crumpled five-dollar bill and five one-dollar bills from her own tips. She didn't need the ten for supplies; she needed it for the matinee movie showing that evening.\n\nThe ten-dollar bill, now sitting alongside stacks of twenties and fifties, spent a brief, quiet interval in the register, absorbing the metallic scent of copper and silver.\n\nWhen Chloe’s shift ended, she pulled out the ten-dollar bill. It felt different now—less crisp, slightly softened by the heat of the register and the friction of other currency.\n\nShe used it to buy a large bag of popcorn and a soda at the dimly lit lobby of the Roxy Cinema. The ticket taker, an elderly gentleman named Mr. Henderson who volunteered his evenings, accepted the bill and gave Chloe her change. Mr. Henderson, known for his frugality and love of crossword puzzles, slipped the ten into his small leather change pouch, planning to use it for his weekly trip to the farmer’s market the next morning.\n\nThe night grew late. Mr. Henderson locked up the cinema, the streets quiet now save for the rumble of the sanitation truck. He decided to walk the few blocks home rather than wait for the late-night trolley. As he walked past a dimly lit park bench, he felt a slight bulge in his jacket pocket. The pouch had snagged on a loose thread.\n\nThe ten-dollar bill slid out, tumbling silently onto the cool, dew-damp grass.\n\nIt rested there until dawn, absorbing the moisture, the scent of damp earth replacing the smell of ink and bakery sugar. It was no longer crisp; it was slightly wrinkled, bearing the faint smudge of grease from Chloe’s popcorn.\n\nAs the sun rose, casting long, ethereal shadows across the park, a small boy named Finn, chasing a runaway soccer ball, stopped dead in his tracks. He saw the flash of green beneath a patch of clover.\n\nFinn picked it up, his small fingers tracing the detailed portrait of Franklin. To Finn, this wasn't just currency; it was potential. It was enough money to buy the rare, highly coveted holographic trading card he’d seen in the window of the comic book shop downtown.\n\nHe clutched the ten-dollar bill tightly, the ghost of its previous journeys—the baker’s counter, the artist’s pavement, the bus floor, the cash register, the park bench—all imprinted invisibly upon its fibrous surface. The ten-dollar bill, having touched the lives of a baker, an artist, a job seeker, a caregiver, a student, and a volunteer, was finally settling into its next, exciting purpose, ready to begin its journey all over again the moment it was spent.",

For example, `command_string.split()` on `\"git commit -m \\\"a message\\\"\"` would produce `['git', 'commit', '-m', '\"a', 'message\"']`, which is likely not what you want.\n\n3.  **Executable and Arguments:**\n    *   After splitting, `parts[0]` will always be the executable name (assuming the string isn't empty or just whitespace).\n    *   The rest of the list `parts[1:]` will contain all the arguments.\n\nThe `parse_command_string` function using `shlex.split` is generally the safer and more correct approach for parsing arbitrary command-line strings that might mimic shell behavior.",

    "raw": "The problem asks us to find the \"special sum\" of a non-negative integer `N`. The special sum is defined as the result of repeatedly summing the digits of a number until the sum becomes a single digit.\n\nLet's break down the problem and explore different approaches.\n\n**Understanding the Process:**\n\n1.  **Start with N.**\n2.  **If N is already a single digit (0-9), that's the special sum.**\n3.  **Otherwise, calculate the sum of its digits.**\n4.  **Take this new sum and repeat steps 2 and 3.**\n\n**Example:**\n`N = 12345`\n1.  `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`\n2.  `15` is not a single digit. Sum its digits: `1 + 5 = 6`\n3.  `6` is a single digit. The special sum is `6`.\n\n`N = 0`\n1.  `0` is a single digit. The special sum is `0`.\n\n---\n\n### Approach 1: Iterative Summation (Direct Simulation)\n\nThis approach directly implements the described process.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Handle the edge case: If `N` is `0`, return `0`.\n2.  While `N` is greater than or equal to `10`:\n    a.  Initialize `current_sum = 0`.\n    b.  While `N > 0`:\n        i.   Add the last digit of `N` to `current_sum` (`N % 10`).\n        ii.  Remove the last digit from `N` (`N //= 10`).\n    c.  Update `N` to `current_sum` for the next iteration.\n3.  Once the loop finishes (meaning `N` is now a single digit), return `N`.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef special_sum_iterative(N: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the special sum of a non-negative integer N using iterative summation.\n\n    The special sum is the result of repeatedly summing the digits of N\n    until the sum becomes a single digit.\n\n    Args:\n        N: A non-negative integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        The single-digit special sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    if N == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    while N >= 10:\n        current_sum = 0\n        temp_N = N # Use a temporary variable to extract digits\n        while temp_N > 0:\n            current_sum += temp_N % 10  # Get the last digit\n            temp_N //= 10             # Remove the last digit\n        N = current_sum  # Update N for the next iteration\n\n    return N\n\n# Test cases\nprint(f\"Special sum of 0: {special_sum_iterative(0)}\")      # Expected: 0\nprint(f\"Special sum of 9: {special_sum_iterative(9)}\")      # Expected: 9\nprint(f\"Special sum of 10: {special_sum_iterative(10)}\")    # Expected: 1 (1+0=1)\nprint(f\"Special sum of 15: {special_sum_iterative(15)}\")    # Expected: 6 (1+5=6)\nprint(f\"Special sum of 12345: {special_sum_iterative(12345)}\") # Expected: 6 (1+2+3+4+5=15 -> 1+5=6)\nprint(f\"Special sum of 987654321: {special_sum_iterative(987654321)}\") # Expected: 9 (9+8+..+1=45 -> 4+5=9)\n```\n\n**Complexity Analysis (Iterative):**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   The outer `while N >= 10` loop runs a small number of times. For a 64-bit integer, the maximum sum of digits is `9 * 19 = 171` (for `2^63-1` which has ~19 digits). The next sum would be `1+7+1 = 9`. So it reduces to a single digit very quickly (at most 2-3 outer loops).\n    *   The inner `while temp_N > 0` loop runs roughly `log10(N)` times (number of digits in `N`).\n    *   Therefore, the complexity is roughly `O(log N)` for practical purposes, as the number of outer loops is constant.\n*   **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we only use a few variables.\n\n---\n\n### Approach 2: Mathematical Property (Digital Root)\n\nThis problem is a classic example of finding the **digital root** of a number. There's a well-known mathematical property for digital roots:\n\n*   If `N = 0`, the digital root is `0`.\n*   If `N > 0`, the digital root is `N % 9`.\n*   **Exception:** If `N % 9 == 0` (and `N > 0`), the digital root is `9`.\n\nThis can be combined into a single concise formula for `N > 0`: `1 + (N - 1) % 9`.\n\n**Let's test the formula `1 + (N - 1) % 9` for `N > 0`:**\n\n*   `N = 9`: `1 + (9 - 1) % 9 = 1 + 8 % 9 = 1 + 8 = 9`. Correct.\n*   `N = 10`: `1 + (10 - 1) % 9 = 1 + 9 % 9 = 1 + 0 = 1`. Correct.\n*   `N = 15`: `1 + (15 - 1) % 9 = 1 + 14 % 9 = 1 + 5 = 6`. Correct.\n*   `N = 12345`: `1 + (12345 - 1) % 9 = 1 + 12344 % 9`.\n    *   `12344 / 9 = 1371` with a remainder of `5`. So `12344 % 9 = 5`.\n    *   `1 + 5 = 6`. Correct.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef special_sum_math(N: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the special sum of a non-negative integer N using a mathematical property (digital root).\n\n    The special sum is the result of repeatedly summing the digits of N\n    until the sum becomes a single digit.\n\n    Args:\n        N: A non-negative integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        The single-digit special sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    if N == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 + (N - 1) % 9\n\n# Test cases\nprint(f\"\\n--- Mathematical Approach ---\")\nprint(f\"Special sum of 0: {special_sum_math(0)}\")      # Expected: 0\nprint(f\"Special sum of 9: {special_sum_math(9)}\")      # Expected: 9\nprint(f\"Special sum of 10: {special_sum_math(10)}\")    # Expected: 1 (1+0=1)\nprint(f\"Special sum of 15: {special_sum_math(15)}\")    # Expected: 6 (1+5=6)\nprint(f\"Special sum of 12345: {special_sum_math(12345)}\") # Expected: 6 (1+2+3+4+5=15 -> 1+5=6)\nprint(f\"Special sum of 987654321: {special_sum_math(987654321)}\") # Expected: 9 (9+8+..+1=45 -> 4+5=9)\n```\n\n**Complexity Analysis (Mathematical):**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** `O(1)` because it involves a fixed number of arithmetic operations (subtraction, modulo, addition), regardless of the magnitude of `N`.\n*   **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`.\n\n---\n\n### Which Approach to Choose?\n\nThe **mathematical approach (`special_sum_math`) is superior** in terms of efficiency. It offers constant time complexity, which is the fastest possible. The iterative approach is also correct and reasonably efficient for typical integer sizes, but the mathematical one is more elegant and performant for very large `N`.\n\nFor an interview or competitive programming setting, recognizing the digital root property is usually the expected optimal solution.\n\n```python\n# Final recommended solution\ndef special_sum(N: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the special sum of a non-negative integer N.\n\n    The special sum is the result of repeatedly summing the digits of N\n    until the sum becomes a single digit. This is also known as the digital root.\n\n    Args:\n        N: A non-negative integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        The single-digit special sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    if N == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 + (N - 1) % 9\n\n```",

    "raw": "To create a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the unique elements while preserving their original order of appearance, you can use a combination of a list to store the results and a set to efficiently track seen elements.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n1.  **Initialize an empty list** for the result (this will maintain order).\n2.  **Initialize an empty set** to keep track of elements that have already been added to the result list. Sets allow for very fast checking of membership (`in` operation) and adding elements.\n3.  **Iterate through the input list**, element by element.\n4.  For each element, **check if it's already in the set of seen elements**.\n    *   If it's **not** in the set, it means this is the first time we've encountered this element. So, add it to the result list and add it to the set of seen elements.\n    *   If it **is** in the set, it means we've already added it to our result list, so we skip it.\n5.  After iterating through the entire input list, return the result list.\n\n```python\ndef get_unique_elements_ordered(input_list: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the input list,\n    maintaining their original order of appearance.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new list with unique elements in their original order.\n    \"\"\"\n    unique_elements = []  # This list will store the unique elements in order\n    seen_elements = set() # This set will keep track of elements we've already added\n\n    for item in input_list:\n        if item not in seen_elements:\n            unique_elements.append(item)\n            seen_elements.add(item)\n            \n    return unique_elements\n\n# --- Test Cases ---\n# 1. Basic test with duplicates\nlist1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 3]\nprint(f\"Original list: {list1}\")\nprint(f\"Unique elements (ordered): {get_unique_elements_ordered(list1)}\")\n# Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# 2. List with no duplicates\nlist2 = [10, 20, 30, 40]\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal list: {list2}\")\nprint(f\"Unique elements (ordered): {get_unique_elements_ordered(list2)}\")\n# Expected output: [10, 20, 30, 40]\n\n# 3. List with all duplicates\nlist3 = [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal list: {list3}\")\nprint(f\"Unique elements (ordered): {get_unique_elements_ordered(list3)}\")\n# Expected output: [7]\n\n# 4. Empty list\nlist4 = []\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal list: {list4}\")\nprint(f\"Unique elements (ordered): {get_unique_elements_ordered(list4)}\")\n# Expected output: []\n\n# 5. List with mixed data types (though the prompt specifies integers, robust for general lists)\nlist5 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'd', 'b']\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal list: {list5}\")\nprint(f\"Unique elements (ordered): {get_unique_elements_ordered(list5)}\")\n# Expected output: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in `input_list`. This is because we iterate through the list once, and set operations (add and `in`) take average O(1) time.\n*   **Space Complexity**: O(N) in the worst case (when all elements are unique). This is because `unique_elements` and `seen_elements` will each store up to N elements.\n\n### Pythonic Alternative (Python 3.7+):\n\nFor a more concise and Pythonic solution (especially in Python 3.7+ where dictionary insertion order is guaranteed), you can leverage `dict.fromkeys()`:\n\n```python\ndef get_unique_elements_ordered_pythonic(input_list: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the input list,\n    maintaining their original order of appearance, using a Pythonic approach.\n    (Relies on dict insertion order guarantee, Python 3.7+)\n\n    Args:\n        input_list: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new list with unique elements in their original order.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(dict.fromkeys(input_list))\n\n# Test with the Pythonic alternative\nlist6 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 3]\nprint(f\"\\nPythonic solution for {list6}: {get_unique_elements_ordered_pythonic(list6)}\")\n# Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n`dict.fromkeys(input_list)` creates a dictionary where keys are the unique elements from `input_list`, and the values are all `None`. Importantly, it preserves the *first* order of appearance of the keys. Converting this dictionary directly to a list (`list(...)`) then gives you the unique elements in that preserved order.",

    "raw": "## A Scent of Paradise: A Review of La Maison de la Truffe\n\nNestled in the heart of Parisian elegance, La Maison de la Truffe isn't just a restaurant; it's a sensory pilgrimage for anyone who worships at the altar of the noble fungus. My recent visit was nothing short of an olfactory and gastronomic revelation, a testament to their unwavering dedication to showcasing the truffle in all its opulent glory.\n\nFrom the moment you step inside, the air is thick with that unmistakable, intoxicating aroma – earthy, musky, a touch of garlic and forest floor. The ambiance is one of understated chic: warm lighting, dark wood, comfortable seating, and tasteful displays of gleaming black and white truffles under glass. It's sophisticated without being stuffy, setting the perfect stage for the culinary journey ahead. The service was impeccable – knowledgeable, discreet, and attentive, with a sommelier ready to guide us through an excellent, truffle-friendly wine list.\n\nOur epicurean adventure began with an appetizer that perfectly encapsulated the restaurant's philosophy: **Scrambled Eggs with Fresh Black Truffle**. Simple in concept, divine in execution. The eggs were impossibly creamy, barely set, providing a velvety canvas for the generous shavings of intensely aromatic black truffle. Each spoonful was a decadent whisper of umami and earth, demonstrating how effortlessly the truffle can elevate even the humblest ingredient.\n\nNext, we savored the **Foie Gras Mi-Cuit with Truffle Shavings**. The foie gras was silken, rich, and perfectly complemented by the delicate crunch and profound aroma of the truffle. It was a symphony of textures and flavors – the unctuousness of the liver meeting the earthy perfume of the truffle in a truly harmonious pairing.\n\nFor our main courses, the choices were tantalizing. I opted for the **Hand-Rolled Tagliatelle with Fresh Black Truffle**. The pasta, cooked to al dente perfection, was coated in a light butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano emulsion, allowing the star of the show to shine. A veritable snowfall of freshly grated black truffle adorned the dish, infusing every strand with its distinct essence. It wasn't just a dish; it was a celebration of texture and profound flavor. My dining companion chose the **Risotto with White Truffle**, an equally breathtaking creation. The creamy arborio rice was permeated with the more pungent, slightly garlicky notes of the white truffle, its ethereal aroma wafting across the table with every stir. The white truffle, shaved tableside with a flourish, offered a different, yet equally captivating, profile.\n\nEven the cheese course continued the truffle theme, with a selection of aged cheeses accompanied by a delicate truffle honey and a subtly truffle-infused fig jam. While we skipped dessert, options like truffle-infused chocolate creations or truffle honey ice cream hinted at the kitchen's creative breadth.\n\nLa Maison de la Truffe is more than just a restaurant; it's an institution dedicated to the art of the truffle. Every dish, from the seemingly simple to the elegantly complex, highlights the truffle's versatility and unparalleled ability to transform a meal into an unforgettable experience. Yes, it's an indulgence, and the prices reflect the rarity of its star ingredient, but for any true foodie or truffle aficionado, it's an essential destination.\n\nCome here to revel in the rich, earthy magic of the truffle, to experience a culinary journey that tantalizes every sense, and to leave with the intoxicating scent of luxury lingering on your palate. La Maison de la Truffe is, quite simply, a gastronomic treasure.",

    "raw": "What is the relationship between the speed of sound and the density of the medium?\n\nThe relationship between the speed of sound and the density of the medium is **inverse**, provided that other factors, particularly the **bulk modulus** (or **elasticity**) of the medium, are kept constant.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of this relationship:\n\n---\n\n## 1. The General Equation for the Speed of Sound\n\nThe speed of sound ($v$) in any medium (solid, liquid, or gas) is generally determined by its **elastic properties** (how easily it can be compressed or deformed) and its **inertial properties** (its density).\n\nThe fundamental equation is:\n\n$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{\\rho}}$$\n\nWhere:\n*   $v$ is the speed of sound.\n*   $K$ is the **Bulk Modulus** (or a similar elastic constant, like Young's Modulus for solids), which represents the medium's stiffness or resistance to compression.\n*   $\\rho$ (rho) is the **density** of the medium (mass per unit volume).\n\n## 2. The Inverse Relationship\n\nLooking at the formula $v = \\sqrt{K/\\rho}$:\n\n*   **If the bulk modulus ($K$) is constant:** The speed of sound ($v$) is inversely proportional to the square root of the density ($\\rho$).\n    $$v \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}}$$\n*   **Interpretation:** For media that are equally stiff (have the same bulk modulus), a **denser** medium will slow down sound propagation, and a **less dense** medium will allow sound to travel faster.\n\n**Why this happens:** Density relates to inertia. Sound travels as a wave of compression and rarefaction. If the medium is denser (more massive particles), it takes more force and more time to accelerate those particles back and forth to propagate the wave disturbance, resulting in a slower wave speed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Specific Contexts and Exceptions\n\nWhile the inverse relationship holds mathematically when comparing media of similar stiffness, in the real world, comparing different states of matter (gas vs. liquid vs. solid) complicates things because the bulk modulus ($K$) changes drastically.\n\n### A. Gases\n\nIn ideal gases, the speed of sound is given by:\n$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma P}{\\rho}} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad v = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma R T}{M}}$$\n\nWhere:\n*   $\\gamma$ is the adiabatic index.\n*   $P$ is the pressure.\n*   $R$ is the gas constant.\n*   $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n*   $M$ is the molar mass.\n\nIn this case, if temperature ($T$) is held constant (as in comparing different gases at the same temperature), the speed of sound **is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass** (which is directly related to density, $\\rho$). Lighter gases (lower density) have faster sound speeds (e.g., sound travels faster in Helium than in Air).\n\n### B. Solids, Liquids, and Gases (General Comparison)\n\nWhen comparing solids, liquids, and gases:\n\n| Medium | Typical Bulk Modulus ($K$) | Typical Density ($\\rho$) | Resulting Speed ($v$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Gas** | Very Low | Very Low | Slowest ($v \\approx 343 \\text{ m/s in air}$) |\n| **Liquid** | Medium | Medium | Faster ($v \\approx 1500 \\text{ m/s in water}$) |\n| **Solid** | Very High | High | Fastest ($v > 5000 \\text{ m/s in steel}$) |\n\nIn this general comparison, **solids are the fastest despite having the highest density**. This occurs because the **increase in the Bulk Modulus ($K$) far outweighs the increase in density ($\\rho$)**. The stiffness of solids is so great that it dominates the relationship, causing sound to travel much faster than in liquids or gases.\n\n## Summary\n\n1.  **When comparing media of similar elastic properties (similar $K$):** The relationship is **inverse** ($v \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\rho}$). Denser media slow down sound.\n2.  **When comparing different states of matter (Gas vs. Liquid vs. Solid):** The relationship is complex. Although density increases from gas to liquid to solid, the **elasticity ($K$) increases even more dramatically**, leading to sound traveling fastest in the stiffest (and densest) medium—solids.",

    "raw": "The **European Union (EU)** is a unique political and economic partnership of 27 member states located primarily in Europe.\n\nHere is a comprehensive overview of the EU, covering its history, structure, objectives, and impact:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Identity and Function\n\nThe EU is often described as a **supranational political and economic union**. This means that member states have pooled some of their sovereignty, allowing EU institutions to make binding decisions in specific areas that apply across all member countries.\n\n*   **Members:** Currently 27 Member States (following the UK's departure, or \"Brexit,\" in 2020).\n*   **Official Languages:** 24.\n*   **Currency:** The **Euro (€)**, used by 20 member states (the Eurozone).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Historical Evolution\n\nThe EU was born out of the desire to ensure lasting peace after the devastating World Wars by linking the economies of Europe.\n\n| Phase | Key Development | Significance |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1951** | **Treaty of Paris** | Established the **European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)** by the \"Inner Six\" (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands). |\n| **1957** | **Treaties of Rome** | Created the **European Economic Community (EEC)**, establishing a common market. |\n| **1973-1995** | **Enlargement** | Membership expanded to include the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Austria. |\n| **1993** | **Maastricht Treaty** | Officially established the **European Union (EU)** and laid the groundwork for the Euro and common foreign policy. |\n| **2002** | **Euro Introduction** | Euro banknotes and coins entered circulation in 12 countries. |\n| **2004-2007** | **Major Eastern Enlargement** | Ten Eastern European countries joined, unifying much of the continent. |\n| **2020** | **Brexit** | The United Kingdom formally withdrew from the EU. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key Objectives of the European Union\n\nThe EU operates under several core goals outlined in its founding treaties:\n\n1.  **Promote Peace and Values:** Uphold democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and equality among its citizens.\n2.  **Establish a Single Market (Internal Market):** Ensure the free movement of **Goods, Services, Capital, and People** (the \"Four Freedoms\") without internal tariffs or barriers.\n3.  **Economic and Monetary Union (EMU):** Coordinate economic policies and manage the common currency (the Euro).\n4.  **Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP):** Speak with one voice on the world stage in diplomacy and defense.\n5.  **Cooperation on Justice and Home Affairs:** Work together on issues like immigration, asylum, and combating cross-border crime.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Institutions of the European Union\n\nThe EU's decision-making process involves several key institutions that balance the interests of the Member States, the citizens, and the Union as a whole.\n\n### A. The Legislators\n\n| Institution | Role | Composition/Representation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **European Parliament (EP)** | **Represents the citizens.** It co-decides on EU laws, approves the EU budget, and oversees other EU institutions. | Directly elected by EU citizens every five years (currently ~705 Members of the European Parliament, or MEPs). |\n| **Council of the European Union** (Council of Ministers) | **Represents the governments of the Member States.** It negotiates, adopts, and amends EU laws, usually jointly with the Parliament. | Composed of relevant government ministers from each Member State (e.g., Finance Ministers meet for economic issues). |\n\n### B. The Executive\n\n| Institution | Role | Composition/Representation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **European Commission** | **The executive arm and initiator of legislation.** It proposes new laws, implements decisions, upholds the EU treaties, and manages the EU budget. | 27 Commissioners (one from each Member State), headed by the President of the Commission. |\n\n### C. The Judiciary and Finance\n\n| Institution | Role | Significance |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)** | **Ensures that EU law is interpreted and applied uniformly** across all Member States. | Its rulings are supreme over national laws in areas where the EU has competence. |\n| **European Central Bank (ECB)** | **Manages the Euro** and sets monetary policy for the Eurozone countries. | Based in Frankfurt, Germany. |\n| **European Council** | **Sets the EU’s overall political direction and priorities.** (Note: This is distinct from the Council of the EU). | Composed of the Heads of State or Government of the 27 Member States, the President of the European Council, and the President of the Commission. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Major Policy Areas\n\nThe EU's influence spans nearly every aspect of life within the Union:\n\n*   **Single Market:** The free movement of goods means that a product legally sold in one EU country can generally be sold in all others without re-testing or tariffs.\n*   **Agriculture (CAP):** The Common Agricultural Policy provides subsidies and support to farmers across the bloc.\n*   **Trade Policy:** The EU negotiates trade agreements with third countries as a single bloc, giving it immense global bargaining power.\n*   **Digital Policy:** The EU is a global leader in digital regulation, notably with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and the **Digital Services Act (DSA)**.\n*   **Environmental Policy:** Sets ambitious climate targets (e.g., the European Green Deal) aimed at making the EU climate-neutral by 2050.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Criticisms and Challenges\n\nDespite its successes, the EU faces ongoing challenges:\n\n1.  **Democratic Deficit:** Critics argue that the most powerful body, the European Commission, is not directly elected, leading to concerns about accountability.\n2.  **Sovereignty Loss:** Member states often struggle with the degree of control they must cede to Brussels, particularly on sensitive issues like taxation or immigration.\n3.  **Bureaucracy (\"Red Tape\"):** The sheer volume of regulations can be seen as burdensome, especially for small businesses.\n4.  **Internal Division:** Differences in economic strength (e.g., North vs. South Europe) and political values (e.g., disagreements over the rule of law in certain Eastern member states) cause tension.",

Calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) for Project A.\n2. Calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) for Project B.\n3.

Recommendation\n\nSince the projects are **mutually exclusive**, the company should select the project that provides the highest positive Net Present Value, as this maximizes shareholder wealth.\n\nComparing the results:\n$$\\text{NPV}_A (\\$15,328.90) > \\text{NPV}_B (\\$8,234.22)$$\n\n**Recommendation:** The company should choose **Project A**.",

    "raw": "It's interesting that you describe this as a \"special case\" of Fibonacci, as the sequence you've provided:\n*   `f(0) = 0`\n*   `f(1) = 1`\n*   `f(2) = 1` (`0 + 1`)\n*   `f(3) = 2` (`1 + 1`)\n*   `f(4) = 3` (`1 + 2`)\n*   `f(5) = 5` (`2 + 3`)\n\n...is precisely the standard definition of the Fibonacci sequence, where `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)` with base cases `F(0)=0` and `F(1)=1`.\n\nPerhaps the \"special\" aspect you're referring to is the implementation itself, aiming for an efficient way to calculate it. A common and efficient way to calculate Fibonacci numbers is using an iterative approach, which has `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity.\n\nHere's a Python function for this:\n\n```python\ndef fib_special(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the nth Fibonacci number for the given 'special' case.\n    This sequence follows the standard Fibonacci definition:\n    f(0) = 0\n    f(1) = 1\n    f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n > 1\n\n    Args:\n        n: The non-negative integer index for the Fibonacci number.\n\n    Returns:\n        The nth Fibonacci number.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If n is a negative integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input 'n' must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        # Initialize with f(0) and f(1)\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        # Iterate from the 2nd number up to the nth number\n        # Each iteration calculates the next Fibonacci number\n        for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return b\n\n# --- Test Cases ---\nprint(f\"fib_special(0) = {fib_special(0)}\")   # Expected: 0\nprint(f\"fib_special(1) = {fib_special(1)}\")   # Expected: 1\nprint(f\"fib_special(2) = {fib_special(2)}\")   # Expected: 1\nprint(f\"fib_special(3) = {fib_special(3)}\")   # Expected: 2\nprint(f\"fib_special(4) = {fib_special(4)}\")   # Expected: 3\nprint(f\"fib_special(5) = {fib_special(5)}\")   # Expected: 5\nprint(f\"fib_special(6) = {fib_special(6)}\")   # Expected: 8\nprint(f\"fib_special(10) = {fib_special(10)}\") # Expected: 55\nprint(f\"fib_special(20) = {fib_special(20)}\") # Expected: 6765\n\ntry:\n    print(f\"fib_special(-1) = {fib_special(-1)}\")\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(f\"Error for negative input: {e}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation of the \"Special\" (Iterative) Approach:**\n\n1.  **Base Cases:**\n    *   If `n` is 0, the function immediately returns 0.\n    *   If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 1.\n    *   These handle the starting points of the sequence.\n\n2.  **Initialization:**\n    *   `a, b = 0, 1` sets up two variables to hold the two most recent Fibonacci numbers. Initially, `a` holds `F(0)` and `b` holds `F(1)`.\n\n3.  **Iteration:**\n    *   The `for _ in range(2, n + 1):` loop starts from index 2 (since `F(0)` and `F(1)` are already known) and goes up to `n`.\n    *   Inside the loop, `a, b = b, a + b` is the core of the calculation:\n        *   The new `a` becomes the old `b` (shifting the sequence forward).\n        *   The new `b` becomes the sum of the old `a` and old `b` (calculating the next Fibonacci number).\n    *   This effectively updates `a` to `F(i-1)` and `b` to `F(i)` in each step, until `b` holds `F(n)`.\n\n4.  **Return Value:**\n    *   After the loop completes, `b` will contain the `nth` Fibonacci number, which is then returned.\n\nThis iterative method is generally preferred over naive recursion for Fibonacci sequences because it avoids recalculating values multiple times, making it much more efficient for larger `n`.",

A set automatically handles uniqueness, so duplicates are ignored.\n2.  **Check for \"skip\" Substring:** I'll then check if the string contains the exact substring \"skip\" (case-sensitive).\n3.  **Apply Exclusion Rule (if necessary):** If \"skip\" is found in the string, I will remove the character 's' (lowercase) from my set of unique characters. I'll use `set.discard('s')` which safely removes 's' if it's present, and does nothing if 's' is not in the set, avoiding errors.\n4.  **Count and Return:** Finally, I'll count the number of characters remaining in the set and provide that as the result.\n\nLet's process the string you provide.

    "raw": "The **Lydian Dominant scale** is a fascinating and colorful scale that is widely used in jazz, fusion, and contemporary music for its bright, somewhat \"out-of-this-world\" sound.\n\nIt is often used over a **dominant seventh chord (V7)** when you want a sound that is both dominant and major, but with a distinctly Lydian flavor.\n\nHere is a complete breakdown of the Lydian Dominant scale.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Scale Formula and Intervals\n\nThe Lydian Dominant scale is essentially a **Mixolydian scale with a raised fourth degree ($\\sharp 4$)**. It is also known as the **Mixolydian $\\sharp 11$ scale**.\n\nThe formula for the Lydian Dominant scale is:\n\n$$\\text{Root} \\ (1) - \\text{Major Second} \\ (2) - \\text{Major Third} \\ (3) - \\text{Augmented Fourth} \\ (\\sharp 4 \\text{ or } \\flat 5) - \\text{Perfect Fifth} \\ (5) - \\text{Major Sixth} \\ (6) - \\text{Minor Seventh} \\ (b7)$$\n\n**Interval Pattern (in half steps):**\n$$\\text{Whole} - \\text{Whole} - \\text{Whole} - \\text{Half} - \\text{Whole} - \\text{Half} - \\text{Whole}$$\n\n**(2) - (2) - (2) - (1) - (2) - (1) - (2)**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Construction Example (C Lydian Dominant)\n\nIf we take the **C** note as the root:\n\n| Degree | Interval | Note Name |\n| :----: | :------: | :-------: |\n| 1      | Root     | **C**     |\n| 2      | Major 2nd| **D**     |\n| 3      | Major 3rd| **E**     |\n| $\\sharp 4$| Augmented 4th| **F$\\sharp$** |\n| 5      | Perfect 5th| **G**     |\n| 6      | Major 6th| **A**     |\n| $b7$   | Minor 7th| **B$\\flat$** |\n\n**The C Lydian Dominant Scale is: C - D - E - F$\\sharp$ - G - A - B$\\flat$**\n\n### Relationship to Other Scales\n\nThe Lydian Dominant scale is the **fourth mode of the Melodic Minor scale.**\n\n*   The **C Lydian Dominant** scale is the 4th mode of the **G Melodic Minor** scale.\n    *   G Melodic Minor: G - A - B$\\flat$ - C - D - E - F$\\sharp$ (When you start on the 4th note, C, you get C - D - E - F$\\sharp$ - G - A - B$\\flat$)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Sound and Application\n\n### The Key Characteristic\n\nThe defining sound of the Lydian Dominant scale comes from the **$\\sharp 4$ (or $\\sharp 11$) interval against the root and the minor seventh ($b7$)**.\n\n*   The **Major Third** gives it a bright, major quality (like a Major scale).\n*   The **Minor Seventh** gives it a dominant quality (like a Dominant 7th chord).\n*   The **$\\sharp 11$** adds the distinctive, exotic, and slightly tense color associated with the Lydian mode.\n\n### Harmonic Context (Chord Voicing)\n\nThis scale is almost exclusively used over a **Dominant Seventh chord with a sharp eleventh ($\\text{V7}\\sharp 11$)**.\n\nFor example, in the key of C Major, the V chord is G7. If you use the G Lydian Dominant scale, you are implying a **G7($\\sharp 11$)** chord (G - B - D - F - C$\\sharp$).\n\n**Common Usage:**\n\n1.  **V7 to I in Jazz:** It is the most common scale used for improvisation when playing the V7 chord that resolves to a Major I chord (e.g., G7 to Cmaj7).\n2.  **Tritone Substitution:** It is often used over the tritone substitution of the V chord (e.g., D$\\flat 7\\sharp 11$ resolving to Cmaj7).\n3.  **Modal Contexts:** Used heavily in fusion and instrumental rock music when the harmony is cycling through altered dominant chords.\n\n### Comparison with Related Scales\n\n| Scale Name | Intervals (from Root) | Key Characteristic |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Mixolydian** | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, $b7$ | The standard dominant scale (Implies $7 \\text{ or } 7sus$) |\n| **Lydian Dominant** | 1, 2, 3, $\\sharp 4$, 5, 6, $b7$ | Bright, exotic sound (Implies $7\\sharp 11$) |\n| **Altered Scale** | 1, $b2$, $\\sharp 2$, 3, $\\sharp 4$, $b5$, $b7$ | Highly tense, tense dominant sound (Implies $7alt$) |\n\nIn short, the Lydian Dominant scale provides the sound of a **Major chord quality (3rd)** combined with a **Dominant color ($b7$)**, spiced up with the **bright tension of the $\\sharp 11$**.",

I will explain my interpretation of the instruction and my plan for execution, which is essentially to just confirm understanding after the thought.\"\n    *   \"I will ensure this thought block itself is comprehensive enough to demonstrate a clear thought process, even if the 'problem' is just the instruction itself.\"\n\n6.  **Formulate the Final \"Response\" outside the thought block:** A concise statement that confirms understanding and readiness.\n</thought>\nUnderstood.

    "raw": "To parse a command string like `\"mv a b\"` into its command and a list of arguments, you can use Python's `split()` method. For more robust parsing, especially if arguments might contain spaces and be quoted, the `shlex` module is a better choice.\n\nLet's look at both methods:\n\n### 1. Using `str.split()` (Simple Cases)\n\nThis method is straightforward and works well for commands where arguments are separated by single or multiple spaces and don't contain spaces themselves (unless they are escaped, which `split()` won't handle directly).\n\n```python\ncommand_string = \"mv a b\"\n\n# Split the string by whitespace. By default, split() handles\n# multiple spaces and strips leading/trailing whitespace.\nparts = command_string.split()\n\nif parts:\n    command = parts[0]      # The first element is the command\n    arguments = parts[1:]   # The rest are the arguments\nelse:\n    command = \"\"\n    arguments = []\n\nprint(f\"Original string: '{command_string}'\")\nprint(f\"Command: '{command}'\")\nprint(f\"Arguments: {arguments}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Another example (ls with one arg) ---\")\ncommand_string_ls = \"ls -l\"\nparts_ls = command_string_ls.split()\ncommand_ls = parts_ls[0]\narguments_ls = parts_ls[1:]\nprint(f\"Original string: '{command_string_ls}'\")\nprint(f\"Command: '{command_ls}'\")\nprint(f\"Arguments: {arguments_ls}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Another example (no args) ---\")\ncommand_string_no_args = \"pwd\"\nparts_no_args = command_string_no_args.split()\ncommand_no_args = parts_no_args[0] if parts_no_args else \"\"\narguments_no_args = parts_no_args[1:] if parts_no_args else []\nprint(f\"Original string: '{command_string_no_args}'\")\nprint(f\"Command: '{command_no_args}'\")\nprint(f\"Arguments: {arguments_no_args}\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nOriginal string: 'mv a b'\nCommand: 'mv'\nArguments: ['a', 'b']\n\n--- Another example (ls with one arg) ---\nOriginal string: 'ls -l'\nCommand: 'ls'\nArguments: ['-l']\n\n--- Another example (no args) ---\nOriginal string: 'pwd'\nCommand: 'pwd'\nArguments: []\n```\n\n### 2. Using `shlex.split()` (Robust Parsing)\n\nThe `shlex` module is designed for parsing shell-like syntax. It correctly handles quoted strings (single or double quotes), escaped characters, and comments. This is the recommended approach for more complex or real-world scenarios.\n\n```python\nimport shlex\n\ncommand_string = \"mv a b\"\n\n# shlex.split() will parse the string like a Unix shell\nparts = shlex.split(command_string)\n\nif parts:\n    command = parts[0]\n    arguments = parts[1:]\nelse:\n    command = \"\"\n    arguments = []\n\nprint(f\"Original string: '{command_string}'\")\nprint(f\"Command: '{command}'\")\nprint(f\"Arguments: {arguments}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Example with quoted arguments ---\")\ncommand_string_quoted = \"cp 'my document with spaces.txt' \\\"another file.pdf\\\"\"\nparts_quoted = shlex.split(command_string_quoted)\ncommand_quoted = parts_quoted[0]\narguments_quoted = parts_quoted[1:]\nprint(f\"Original string: '{command_string_quoted}'\")\nprint(f\"Command: '{command_quoted}'\")\nprint(f\"Arguments: {arguments_quoted}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Example with escaped spaces ---\")\ncommand_string_escaped = \"rm my\\\\ file.txt\"\nparts_escaped = shlex.split(command_string_escaped)\ncommand_escaped = parts_escaped[0]\narguments_escaped = parts_escaped[1:]\nprint(f\"Original string: '{command_string_escaped}'\")\nprint(f\"Command: '{command_escaped}'\")\nprint(f\"Arguments: {arguments_escaped}\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nOriginal string: 'mv a b'\nCommand: 'mv'\nArguments: ['a', 'b']\n\n--- Example with quoted arguments ---\nOriginal string: 'cp 'my document with spaces.txt' \"another file.pdf\"'\nCommand: 'cp'\nArguments: ['my document with spaces.txt', 'another file.pdf']\n\n--- Example with escaped spaces ---\nOriginal string: 'rm my\\ file.txt'\nCommand: 'rm'\nArguments: ['my file.txt']\n```\n\n### Which to choose?\n\n*   **`str.split()`:** Use this if you are absolutely sure that your arguments will *never* contain spaces, or if you control the input and it's always simple whitespace-separated values. It's simpler and slightly faster for these specific cases.\n*   **`shlex.split()`:** Use this for almost all real-world scenarios, especially when dealing with user input or parsing actual shell commands, as it provides robust handling for quotes, escapes, and other shell conventions.",

    "raw": "Identify the five most common cognitive biases affecting decision-making in a business context.\n\nHere are five of the most common cognitive biases that significantly impact decision-making in a business context:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Confirmation Bias\n\n**Description:** The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs or values. Decision-makers selectively seek out data that validates their initial hypothesis while ignoring or downplaying contradictory evidence.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n*   **Poor Strategic Choices:** Executives may cling to a failing strategy because they only listen to reports that suggest it’s about to turn around.\n*   **Hiring Mistakes:** Interviewers focus only on questions that confirm their initial positive or negative impression of a candidate, rather than objectively assessing all skills.\n*   **Market Research Flaws:** Teams structure surveys or focus groups to elicit the desired customer feedback, leading to flawed product development.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Availability Heuristic (Availability Bias)\n\n**Description:** A mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method, or decision. Vivid, recent, or emotionally charged events are judged as more likely or frequent than they statistically are.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n*   **Risk Mismanagement:** A company might overinvest in securing against a recent, highly publicized security breach (even if statistically rare) while neglecting more common, but less dramatic, operational risks.\n*   **Product Development:** Management might rush to copy a competitor's recent, highly successful new feature, assuming that feature is the primary driver of success, rather than understanding the underlying market dynamics.\n*   **Overconfidence:** A recent string of successful deals makes managers overestimate their future success rate, leading to overly aggressive sales targets.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Anchoring Bias\n\n**Description:** The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the \"anchor\") when making decisions, even if that information is irrelevant. Subsequent judgments are made by adjusting away from the anchor, but rarely far enough.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n*   **Negotiations:** The initial price mentioned by either a buyer or seller sets the range for the entire negotiation, often leading to suboptimal outcomes if the anchor was extreme.\n*   **Budgeting and Forecasting:** The previous year's budget often serves as the anchor for the current year's budget. If the previous budget was inefficiently high, the new budget will likely remain high, regardless of current needs.\n*   **Valuation:** In mergers and acquisitions, the seller’s initial asking price heavily influences the buyer’s final offer, even if the true intrinsic value is much lower.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Sunk Cost Fallacy\n\n**Description:** The tendency to continue investing resources (time, money, effort) into a failing endeavor because of the resources already invested, rather than cutting losses and moving to a better opportunity. The decision is based on past, irrecoverable costs rather than future potential.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n*   **Project Continuation:** A business continues to fund an outdated IT system or a product line that clearly isn't gaining market traction simply because millions have already been spent developing it.\n*   **Hiring and Training:** Managers refuse to fire an underperforming senior employee because the company invested significant money and time training them, hoping they will eventually improve.\n*   **Long-Term Strategy:** Organizations avoid pivoting to a new, necessary technology because they have too much invested in the legacy system.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Overconfidence Bias\n\n**Description:** The tendency for a person's subjective confidence in their judgments to be reliably greater than their objective accuracy. In business, this often manifests as overestimating one's own abilities, knowledge, or the precision of a forecast.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n*   **Project Deadlines:** Managers consistently underestimate the time and resources required for complex projects, leading to missed deadlines and budget overruns.\n*   **Market Entry:** Entrepreneurs or leaders may launch products assuming guaranteed success based on their own skill, failing to adequately prepare for competitive response or market resistance.\n*   **Financial Projections:** Sales teams provide highly optimistic revenue forecasts because they are overly confident in their closing ability, leading to poor resource allocation based on inflated expectations.",

    "raw": "List of historical figures who are generally considered to be innovators in the field of computing.\n\nHere is a list of historical figures generally considered to be innovators in the field of computing, spanning from early theoretical work to the development of modern electronic computers:\n\n---\n\n## Early Theoretical & Mechanical Foundations (Pre-20th Century)\n\nThese figures laid the groundwork for computation, logic, and the concept of programmable machines.\n\n1.  **Charles Babbage (1791–1871):** Often called the \"Father of the Computer.\" He conceived of the **Difference Engine** (an automatic mechanical calculator) and, more importantly, the **Analytical Engine**, which was the first design for a general-purpose, programmable mechanical computer.\n2.  **Ada Lovelace (1815–1852):** A mathematician who worked with Babbage. She recognized that the Analytical Engine could do more than just calculation and wrote what is considered the **first algorithm** intended to be carried out by a machine. She is regarded as the first computer programmer.\n3.  **George Boole (1815–1864):** Developed **Boolean Algebra**, a system of logic that uses only two values (true/false, 1/0). This mathematical foundation is essential to all modern digital circuit design and computer logic.\n4.  **Herman Hollerith (1860–1929):** Invented the **punch card tabulating machine** to process data from the 1890 U.S. Census. His company eventually became part of International Business Machines (IBM).\n5.  **Vannevar Bush (1890–1974):** Designed the **Differential Analyzer** (a large-scale analog computer) in the 1930s. He also proposed the **Memex**, a conceptual electro-mechanical device for storing and linking information, which was highly influential on hypertext and the early internet.\n\n---\n\n## The Dawn of Modern Computing (1930s–1940s)\n\nThis era saw the transition from mechanical to electrical and electromechanical devices, leading directly to the first electronic computers.\n\n6.  **Alan Turing (1912–1954):** A pivotal figure in theoretical computer science. He formalized the concepts of **algorithms and computation** with the theoretical **Turing Machine**. During WWII, he was instrumental in breaking the Enigma code using early electromechanical computation devices (the Bombe).\n7.  **Konrad Zuse (1910–1995):** A German engineer who built the **Z3 (1941)**, generally considered the world's first functional, programmable, fully automatic digital computer. He also developed the Plankalkül, one of the first high-level programming languages.\n8.  **John Atanasoff (1903–1995) & Clifford Berry (1918–1963):** Built the **Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC)** (completed c. 1942), often cited as the first electronic digital computing device. It used vacuum tubes for calculation but was not programmable in the modern sense.\n9.  **John Mauchly (1907–1980) & J. Presper Eckert (1919–1995):** Key figures in the development of the **ENIAC** (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) at the University of Pennsylvania. ENIAC (1945) was the first large-scale, general-purpose, electronic digital computer. They later developed **UNIVAC I**, the first commercial computer in the U.S.\n10. **John von Neumann (1903–1957):** A brilliant mathematician who formalized the concept of the **stored-program architecture** (the **Von Neumann architecture**), where program instructions and data are held in the same memory space. This design is the basis for nearly every computer built since the late 1940s.\n\n---\n\n## Post-War Development and Programming Languages (1950s–1960s)\n\nThese innovators moved computing beyond specialized research and into practical application through memory, languages, and integrated circuits.\n\n11. **Grace Hopper (1906–1992):** A U.S. Navy rear admiral and pioneer in programming. She popularized the concept of machine-independent programming languages and developed the first **compiler** (A-0 System). She was instrumental in the development of **COBOL**.\n12. **Jack Kilby (1923–2005) & Robert Noyce (1927–1990):** Independently invented the **integrated circuit (IC)** or microchip in 1958/1959. This invention drastically reduced the size, cost, and power consumption of electronics, making modern computing possible.\n13. **John McCarthy (1927–2011):** Coined the term **\"Artificial Intelligence\"** in 1955 and invented the programming language **LISP**, which became foundational for AI research.\n14. **Donald Knuth (b. 1938):** Author of *The Art of Computer Programming*, a monumental work that synthesized the foundational mathematics of algorithms. He also invented the TeX typesetting system.\n\n---\n\n## The Personal Computer and Networking Revolution (1970s–1980s)\n\nThese figures brought computing out of specialized labs and into homes and offices.\n\n15. **Robert Metcalfe (b. 1941):** Co-inventor of **Ethernet**, the standard technology for local area networking (LANs), which was crucial for connecting early computers.\n16. **Ted Hoff (b. 1937), Federico Faggin (b. 1941), Stanley Mazor (b. 1934), and Masatoshi Shima (b. 1943):** Key designers at Intel who developed the **Intel 4004 (1971)**, the **first commercially available microprocessor**, placing all the central processing unit components onto a single chip.\n17. **Douglas Engelbart (1925–2013):** Demonstrated many fundamental concepts of modern personal computing in \"The Mother of All Demos\" (1968), including the **computer mouse**, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), hypertext linking, and networked collaboration.\n18. **Steve Jobs (1955–2011) & Steve Wozniak (b. 1950):** Co-founders of Apple. Wozniak engineered the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-market personal computers, while Jobs championed the productization and user experience that made PCs mainstream.\n19. **Bill Gates (b. 1955):** Co-founder of Microsoft. While not an inventor of hardware architecture, he and Paul Allen pioneered the software industry by creating mass-market operating systems (MS-DOS and Windows) that standardized the software interface for the vast majority of personal computers.",

It checks the HTTP status code, logs errors, attempts to parse JSON errors, and `raises_for_status()` for non-2xx codes, turning them into Python exceptions. This allows centralized error handling.\n4.  **API Interaction Functions (`get_resource`, `post_resource`, etc.):**\n    *   Each function (`get_resource`, `post_resource`, `put_resource`, `patch_resource`, `delete_resource`) wraps a specific `requests` method.\n    *   They construct the full URL, handle `params` (for GET query strings), `data` (for POST/PUT/PATCH request bodies), and `headers`.\n    *   They all include a `timeout` parameter to prevent indefinite waiting.\n    *   They use `try...except requests.exceptions.RequestException` to catch network-related errors (connection issues, timeouts, HTTP errors) gracefully.\n    *   `json=data`: For `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `requests` automatically serializes the Python dictionary `data` into JSON and sets the `Content-Type: application/json` header (unless you override it).\n5.  **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block:**\n    *   This block demonstrates how to use each of the API interaction functions.\n    *   It shows examples of:\n        *   Fetching all resources.\n        *   Fetching a single resource by ID.\n        *   Filtering resources using query parameters.\n        *   Creating a new resource.\n        *   Completely replacing a resource (PUT).\n        *   Partially updating a resource (PATCH).\n        *   Deleting a resource.\n    *   **Authentication Examples:** A conceptual section showing how to include API keys, Bearer tokens, or use Basic Authentication. You would uncomment and adapt these for your specific API's authentication method.\n    *   **Error Handling Demo:** Shows what happens when an invalid endpoint is requested.\n6.  **Logging:** Basic logging is set up to provide informational messages and error details.\n\n### Customizing for Your API\n\nTo adapt this script for *your* specific REST API:\n\n1.  **`BASE_URL`:** Change `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` to your API's base URL.\n2.  **`ENDPOINT`:** Adjust the `ENDPOINT` variable and the `endpoint` arguments in the function calls to match your API's paths (e.g., `\"users\"`, `\"products\"`, `\"orders\"`).\n3.  **Request Body (`data`):** For `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, modify the `data` dictionaries to match the JSON structure your API expects.\n4.  **Query Parameters (`params`):** For `GET` requests that support filtering, sorting, or pagination, adjust the `params` dictionary accordingly.\n5.  **Headers:**\n    *   **Authentication:** Crucial for most real-world APIs. Use the `headers` parameter in the functions to pass API keys, `Authorization` (for Bearer tokens), or use the `auth` parameter for Basic Auth.\n    *   **Other Headers:** You might need to send custom headers (e.g., `X-Request-ID`, `Accept-Language`).\n6.  **`expected_status_codes`:** Review the `_handle_response` function's `expected_status_codes` list. While `[200, 201, 204]` are common, your API might return other success codes (e.g., 202 Accepted).\n7.  **Error Handling:** While `requests.exceptions.RequestException` and `_handle_response` provide robust generic error handling, you might want to add more specific logic based on common error responses from *your* API (e.g., parsing specific error codes or messages from the API's JSON error bodies).\n8.  **Return Values:** The functions currently return the JSON response or specific strings. Adjust this if your application needs to process the raw `requests.Response` object directly for more advanced checks.",

    "raw": "# A Beginner's Guide to Understanding and Preventing SQL Injection\n\nSQL Injection (SQLi) is one of the oldest, most prevalent, and dangerous web application vulnerabilities. For anyone building or securing web applications, understanding SQLi is crucial. This guide will break down what it is, how it works, and most importantly, how to prevent it, even if you're just starting out.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is SQL Injection?\n\nLet's start with the basics:\n\n*   **SQL (Structured Query Language):** This is the language used to communicate with and manage relational databases. Almost every dynamic website relies on a database to store user information, product catalogs, blog posts, etc. When you log in, search for a product, or submit a comment, your web application sends SQL commands (called \"queries\") to the database.\n\n*   **Injection:** In the context of cybersecurity, \"injection\" refers to a type of attack where an attacker inserts malicious code into an input field, which is then processed by a program (in this case, a database).\n\n**Putting it together:** SQL Injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g., to dump the database contents to the attacker).\n\n---\n\n## 2. How Does SQL Injection Work? (The \"Injection\" Part)\n\nImagine a login form. When you type your username and password, the web application constructs an SQL query to check if your credentials are valid.\n\n**Scenario: A Vulnerable Login Form**\n\nLet's say a developer writes code that creates an SQL query by directly concatenating (joining) user input strings.\n\nHere's what a *typical, legitimate* query might look like behind the scenes when you enter `john` as the username and `password123` as the password:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john' AND password = 'password123';\n```\nIf these credentials match a record in the `users` table, you're logged in.\n\n**The Attack:**\n\nAn attacker exploits the application by entering carefully crafted input that changes the *meaning* of the SQL query.\n\n**Example 1: Bypassing Authentication**\n\nThe attacker might type the following into the **username** field:\n\n`admin' --`\n\n*(The `--` in SQL is a comment marker, meaning everything after it on the line is ignored by the database.)*\n\nNow, let's see how the vulnerable application builds the query:\n\n1.  **Original Query Structure:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '[user_input]' AND password = '[password_input]';`\n2.  **Attacker's Input:** `admin' --` for username, and anything for password (e.g., `blah`).\n3.  **Resulting Query:**\n    ```sql\n    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'blah';\n    ```\n\n**What the database sees:**\n\nThe database executes: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'`\n\nThe rest of the query (`--' AND password = 'blah';`) is commented out and ignored. If there's a user named `admin` in the database, the condition `username = 'admin'` becomes true, and the attacker is logged in as `admin` (or the first user returned if multiple match). No password needed!\n\n**Example 2: Retrieving All User Data**\n\nAnother common input for bypassing login or dumping data:\n\n`admin' OR '1'='1`\n\nWhen injected into the username field:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'blah';\n```\n\nSince `'1'='1'` is always true, the `OR '1'='1'` part makes the entire `WHERE` clause true. The database will return *all* rows from the `users` table, potentially logging the attacker in as the first user found, or revealing sensitive information.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why is SQL Injection Dangerous?\n\nSQLi attacks can lead to severe consequences:\n\n*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can read, modify, or delete sensitive data (customer records, credit card numbers, passwords, personal information).\n*   **Data Corruption/Deletion:** Attackers can modify or destroy your database's data, causing significant damage and loss of trust.\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** As shown above, attackers can log in as legitimate users or administrators without knowing their credentials.\n*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify content displayed on your website.\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can make your website or application unavailable by corrupting data or overloading the database.\n*   **Remote Code Execution:** In some advanced cases, attackers can even execute arbitrary commands on the server itself, taking full control of the machine.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to Prevent SQL Injection (The Essential Defenses)\n\nPreventing SQLi primarily revolves around one core principle: **never treat user input as executable code.**\n\n### 1. **Parameterized Queries (The #1 Defense)**\n\nThis is the most effective and recommended way to prevent SQL injection. Parameterized queries (also known as Prepared Statements) work by separating the SQL code from the user-supplied data.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nInstead of directly embedding user input into the SQL string, you define the SQL query with \"placeholders\" for the input values. Then, you provide the user input separately, and the database engine understands that these inputs are *data* and not *code*. It will never interpret the input as part of the SQL command itself.\n\n**Analogy:** Think of it like filling out a pre-printed form. The structure of the form (the query) is fixed. You fill in the blanks (the parameters) with your information (the data). No matter what you write in the blanks, it's always treated as data, never as a change to the form's structure.\n\n**Example (Conceptual Code):**\n\nMost modern programming languages and database libraries support parameterized queries. Here's a conceptual example:\n\n```\n// Instead of this (VULNERABLE):\n// query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '\" + user_input + \"' AND password = '\" + pass_input + \"';\"\n// execute(query)\n\n// Do this (SECURE with Parameterized Query):\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?;\" // Or use named parameters like :username, :password\nparameters = [user_input, pass_input]\n\nexecute_prepared_statement(query, parameters)\n```\n\nIn this secure approach, if the attacker inputs `admin' --`, the database will simply search for a username that literally matches `admin' --`. It won't interpret `--` as a comment, and the login will fail (unless there's actually a user named `admin' --`).\n\n**Key Takeaway:** **Always use parameterized queries for *any* SQL query that incorporates user input.** This applies to `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.\n\n### 2. **Input Validation**\n\nWhile parameterized queries are your primary defense, robust input validation is a crucial secondary layer.\n\n*   **What it is:** Checking user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats, lengths, and types.\n*   **How to do it:**\n    *   **Data Type Validation:** If you expect a number, ensure it's a number.\n    *   **Length Validation:** Limit the length of input fields (e.g., usernames usually have a max length).\n    *   **Format Validation:** Use regular expressions to enforce specific patterns (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers, alphanumeric usernames).\n    *   **Whitelisting:** Only allow specific characters or values (e.g., a dropdown list).\n*   **Server-Side Validation:** Always perform validation on the server side. Client-side validation (in the browser) is good for user experience but can be bypassed by attackers.\n\n**Example:** If a username should only contain letters and numbers, validate that the input matches `^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$` before processing.\n\n### 3. **Principle of Least Privilege**\n\nDatabase users should only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    *   Your web application's database user should **NOT** be the database administrator (DBA).\n    *   It should only have `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` permissions on the specific tables it needs to interact with.\n    *   It should *not* have permissions to create tables, drop tables, or modify database schemas.\n    *   It definitely shouldn't have permissions to execute stored procedures that aren't directly part of its function.\n\n### 4. **Robust Error Handling**\n\nDon't display raw database errors to your users. Detailed error messages can inadvertently leak information about your database structure, operating system, and application logic, which attackers can use to craft more precise attacks.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    *   Catch database errors internally.\n    *   Log them securely on the server side for debugging.\n    *   Display generic, user-friendly error messages to the end-user (e.g., \"An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\").\n\n### 5. **Keep Software Up-to-Date**\n\nRegularly update your operating system, database software (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), web server, and application frameworks. Vendors frequently release security patches that fix known vulnerabilities, including potential SQLi vectors.\n\n### 6. **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**\n\nA Web Application Firewall can provide an additional layer of defense by monitoring and filtering HTTP traffic between your application and the internet. WAFs can detect and block many common attack patterns, including SQL injection attempts, before they even reach your application.\n\n*   **Note:** A WAF is a helpful *additional* layer, not a replacement for secure coding practices like parameterized queries.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSQL Injection remains a serious threat, but it's largely preventable with the right practices. As a beginner, focusing on **parameterized queries** should be your top priority for any application that interacts with a database. Combine this with diligent **input validation**, adherence to the **principle of least privilege**, and good **error handling**, and you'll be well on your way to building secure web applications.\n\nAlways remember: trust no input. All data coming from a user or external source should be treated as potentially malicious until proven otherwise.",

    "raw": "A study was conducted to investigate the effect of different lighting conditions on the sleep quality of office workers. The study involved 100 office workers, 50 of whom were exposed to **bright, cool-white light** during the workday (Group A), and 50 of whom were exposed to **dim, warm-yellow light** during the workday (Group B).\n\nAfter three months, the sleep quality of all participants was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality. The average PSQI scores were calculated:\n\n*   **Group A (Bright, Cool-White Light):** Average PSQI Score = 4.5\n*   **Group B (Dim, Warm-Yellow Light):** Average PSQI Score = 6.8\n\n**Question 1:** Based on the results, which lighting condition appears to be associated with **better sleep quality**? Justify your answer using the provided data.\n\n**Question 2:** Formulate a **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** and an **alternative hypothesis ($H_8$)** for a statistical test that could be used to determine if the observed difference in mean PSQI scores between the two groups is statistically significant.\n\n**Question 3:** If the researchers wanted to replicate this study but only included participants who already reported mild sleep disturbances (PSQI scores between 5 and 10 before the study), what type of study design would this represent (e.g., independent groups, repeated measures, crossover, etc.) and why?",

Set $n=0$:\n$$1 = A(1)(2) + 0 + 0 \\implies 2A = 1 \\implies A = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n2. Set $n=-1$:\n$$1 = 0 + B(-1)(-1+2) + 0 \\implies 1 = B(-1)(1) \\implies -B = 1 \\implies B = -1$$\n\n3. Set $n=-2$:\n$$1 = 0 + 0 + C(-2)(-2+1) \\implies 1 = C(-2)(-1) \\implies 2C = 1 \\implies C = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n$$\\frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} = \\frac{1}{2n} - \\frac{1}{n+1} + \\frac{1}{2(n+2)}$$\n\nWe can group the terms to see the telescoping nature more clearly:\n$$\\frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right) - \\frac{1}{n+1}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{2}{n+1} + \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right)$$\n\nLet $S_N$ be the $N$-th partial sum:\n$$S_N = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{2}{n+1} + \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right)$$\n$$2S_N = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{2}{n+1} + \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right)$$\n\nLet's write out the first few terms of the sum $2S_N$:\n$n=1: \\quad \\left( \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = 1 - 1 + \\frac{1}{3}$\n$n=2: \\quad \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} \\right)$\n$n=3: \\quad \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} \\right)$\n$n=4: \\quad \\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} \\right)$\n...\n$n=N-1: \\left( \\frac{1}{N-1} - \\frac{2}{N} + \\frac{1}{N+1} \\right)$\n$n=N: \\quad \\left( \\frac{1}{N} - \\frac{2}{N+1} + \\frac{1}{N+2} \\right)$\n\nLet's sum the columns vertically:\nThe coefficient of $\\frac{1}{k}$ comes from the terms where $n=k$, $n+1=k$ (i.e., $n=k-1$), and $n+2=k$ (i.e., $n=k-2$).\n\nFor $k \\ge 3$:\nCoefficient of $\\frac{1}{k}$ is $1$ (from $n=k$) $- 2$ (from $n=k-1$) $+ 1$ (from $n=k-2$) $= 0$.\n\nWe only need to look at the beginning and the end terms.\n\nTerms remaining from the beginning ($n=1, 2$):\n$n=1$: $1 - 1 + \\frac{1}{3}$\n$n=2$: $\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nCombining the coefficients for small indices:\n$\\frac{1}{1}$: Appears only in $n=1$ with coefficient $+1$.

(Total coefficient $1 - 2 + 1 = 0$)\n\nThe final surviving terms (for large $N$) are:\n$$(-1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{N+1} + (1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{N+2}$$\n\nThe partial sum $2S_N$ is:\n$$2S_N = \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\left( - \\frac{1}{N+1} + \\frac{1}{N+2} \\right)$$\n$$2S_N = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{N+1} + \\frac{1}{N+2}$$\n\nTo find the infinite sum $S$, we take the limit as $N \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} 2S_N = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{N+1} + \\frac{1}{N+2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - 0 + 0 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSince $2S = \\frac{1}{2}$, the sum $S$ is:\n$$S = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThe value of the expression is $\\frac{1}{4}$, which corresponds to option A.",
