    "raw": "## Review: The Golden Spoon - An Exquisite Culinary Journey\n\n**Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)**\n\nDining at The Golden Spoon is less a meal and more an exquisite culinary journey, an experience that lives up to its opulent moniker in every delightful way. From the moment you step through its discreet entrance, you're transported to a world where every detail is meticulously curated, promising an evening of unparalleled gastronomic pleasure.\n\n**Ambiance: Understated Elegance (5/5)**\nThe interior of The Golden Spoon strikes a perfect balance between classic luxury and contemporary sophistication. Warm, intimate lighting bathes the dining room, highlighting rich textures – think velvet upholstery, polished dark wood, and gleaming, heavy cutlery that feels substantial in your hand. Tables are thoughtfully spaced, ensuring privacy for hushed conversations, and the ambient music is a soft, unobtrusive hum. It’s an atmosphere designed for special occasions, radiating a quiet confidence rather than flashy extravagance.\n\n**Service: Seamless and Impeccable (5/5)**\nThe staff at The Golden Spoon exemplify what truly professional service should be. Attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable without being pretentious, they anticipate your needs with a graceful efficiency that is truly remarkable. From the charming hostess to the sommelier with an encyclopedic knowledge of their extensive wine list, and the servers who glide silently, appearing just when needed, the entire team contributes to a flawless experience. Questions about ingredients or preparation are answered with confidence and genuine enthusiasm.\n\n**The Food: A Symphony of Flavors and Artistry (5/5)**\nAnd then, there is the food. The Golden Spoon's kitchen is a realm of culinary artistry, where premium ingredients are transformed into edible masterpieces.\n\n*   **Appetizers:** We began with the **Seared Diver Scallops** resting on a bed of delicate saffron risotto, accompanied by a surprising yet delightful lemon zest foam. The scallops were perfectly caramelized, tender within, and the risotto was creamy, subtly flavored.\n*   **Main Course:** For my main, I chose the **Herb-Crusted Rack of Lamb**, served with a vibrant cherry reduction and gratin dauphinoise. The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium-rare, meltingly tender, and the herbaceous crust provided a wonderful counterpoint to the sweet-tart reduction. My dining companion raved about the **Pan-Seared Chilean Sea Bass**, which was flaky and moist, paired with a light asparagus puree and crispy edible flowers.\n*   **Wine Pairing:** The sommelier’s recommendations were spot-on, enhancing each course beautifully. Their ability to pair complex flavors with equally complex wines elevated the entire meal.\n*   **Dessert:** Of course, one must indulge in dessert at \"The Golden Spoon.\" We shared their signature **Deconstructed Tiramisu**, presented almost like a miniature abstract sculpture with delicate mascarpone clouds, espresso pearls, and cocoa \"soil,\" all adorned with a whisper of edible gold leaf. It was a playful yet elegant reimagining of a classic, and utterly delicious.\n\nEvery dish was a visual delight, plated with precision and creativity, showcasing a respect for ingredients and an innovative spirit. The flavors were bold yet harmonious, surprising yet comforting.\n\n**Overall Experience & Value: Worth Every Penny (5/5)**\nThe Golden Spoon is undoubtedly an investment, a splurge. But it is an investment in an unforgettable experience. It's not just about the incredible food; it’s about the entire ballet of service, the serene ambiance, and the feeling of being truly pampered. For special occasions – anniversaries, significant birthdays, or simply when you want to treat yourself to something truly extraordinary – The Golden Spoon sets a benchmark for luxury dining.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Golden Spoon is more than just a restaurant; it’s a destination for discerning palates and those seeking an evening of pure culinary indulgence. It lives up to its grand promise, delivering an experience that is consistently exceptional. Highly, unequivocally recommended.",

    "raw": "Based on the context of your request, it seems you are asking for information about **\"context\"** in general, or perhaps in a specific domain like Natural Language Processing (NLP), communication, or philosophy, as the term itself is very broad.\n\nSince you didn't provide a specific area, I will give you a comprehensive overview of **\"Context\"** across different fields.\n\n---\n\n## Context: A Comprehensive Overview\n\n**Context** (from the Latin *contexere*, meaning \"to weave together\") refers to the circumstances, background, setting, or framework that surrounds an event, statement, idea, or piece of information, and which is necessary to fully understand its meaning, significance, or relevance.\n\nWithout context, information is often ambiguous, misleading, or meaningless.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Context in Communication and Language\n\nIn daily interaction, context dictates how we interpret what others say or do.\n\n### Key Components of Communication Context:\n\n1.  **Linguistic Context (Co-text):** The words, sentences, and discourse that surround a specific word or phrase.\n    *   *Example:* The meaning of the word \"bank\" changes depending on whether the surrounding text mentions \"river\" or \"money.\"\n2.  **Situational/Physical Context:** The immediate physical environment where the communication is occurring.\n    *   *Example:* Shouting \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater has a very different context than whispering it near a campfire.\n3.  **Social/Relational Context:** The relationship between the communicators (e.g., friends, boss/employee, strangers).\n    *   *Example:* A joke told between close friends might be offensive if told by a new acquaintance.\n4.  **Cultural Context:** The shared beliefs, norms, and values of the groups involved.\n    *   *Example:* A gesture considered polite in one culture might be rude in another.\n5.  **Historical Context:** The background knowledge of past events that shape the current situation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Context in Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nIn computational linguistics and AI, context is crucial for machines to understand human language effectively.\n\n### Types of Context in NLP:\n\n*   **Local Context:** The immediate surrounding words (e.g., within a sentence or a few preceding/succeeding sentences). This is key for disambiguation (Word Sense Disambiguation).\n*   **Global Context (Document/Conversation Level):** The overall topic, history of the conversation, or the document being analyzed. This allows systems like chatbots or translation software to maintain coherence over long interactions.\n*   **Contextual Embeddings (Modern NLP):** Deep learning models (like BERT or GPT) generate word representations (vectors) that change based on the surrounding context. This revolutionized the ability of machines to handle polysemy (words with multiple meanings).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Context in Philosophy and Hermeneutics\n\nIn philosophy, particularly in fields concerned with interpretation (hermeneutics), context determines the truth or validity of an argument.\n\n*   **Intentional Context:** Understanding the author's original purpose, beliefs, and historical situation when they created a text.\n*   **Reader/Interpreter Context:** Recognizing that the modern reader brings their own background and assumptions, which can alter interpretation (the \"reception theory\").\n\n---\n\n## 4. Context in User Experience (UX) and Technology\n\nIn technology design, context refers to the user's current state, location, and intentions.\n\n*   **Context-Aware Computing:** Systems designed to react automatically to the user’s context.\n    *   *Example:* A smartphone automatically switches to silent mode when it detects the user is in a meeting location (based on calendar data) or traveling (based on location data).\n    *   *Example:* Navigation apps using real-time traffic (context) to reroute you.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Field | What is Context? | Why is it Important? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Communication** | The environment, relationships, and culture surrounding an interaction. | Ensures shared meaning and prevents misinterpretation. |\n| **NLP/AI** | The surrounding words, sentences, or historical dialogue in a dataset. | Enables accurate machine comprehension, translation, and response generation. |\n| **Philosophy** | The historical and authorial setting of a text or event. | Determines the valid interpretation and meaning of complex ideas. |\n| **Technology/UX** | The user's location, activity, time of day, and device state. | Allows for personalized, proactive, and relevant system behavior. |",

    "raw": "Based on your request, here is a brief analysis of the **Cranberry Bog** as a potential setting, considering its inherent characteristics and implications for storytelling or design:\n\n---\n\n## Analysis of the Cranberry Bog Setting\n\nThe Cranberry Bog is a highly evocative and atmospheric setting, rich with specific sensory details, ecological features, and potential narrative tension.\n\n### 1. Sensory Experience & Atmosphere\n\n*   **Visuals:** Dominated by shades of deep red, rusty orange, and dark, opaque water. The environment is generally flat, leading to a vast, seemingly unending horizon, often shrouded in mist or low fog. The presence of the hardy cranberry vines creates a dense, low-lying texture.\n*   **Auditory:** Silence is often the defining feature, broken only by the slight *slosh* of water, the buzz of specific insects (like mosquitoes), or the distant call of specialized marsh birds.\n*   **Tactile/Olfactory:** The air is perpetually damp, cool, and heavy. The ground is unstable, yielding, and often muddy beneath the surface level. The smell is earthy, vegetal, and slightly acidic.\n\n### 2. Narrative Implications & Themes\n\nThe bog setting naturally lends itself to themes involving **isolation, hidden truths, stagnation, and preservation.**\n\n*   **Isolation/Liminal Space:** Bogs are natural barriers. They are neither solid land nor open water, making them difficult to traverse. This naturally separates characters from the outside world, heightening reliance on one another or increasing the danger of being lost.\n*   **Preservation (The \"Bog Body\" Trope):** Bogs are anaerobic environments that naturally preserve organic matter, sometimes including bodies or artifacts, in a state of near-perfect suspension. This immediately suggests mysteries, forgotten histories, or unearthed secrets.\n*   **Danger Underfoot:** The primary physical threat is the instability of the ground. Characters are constantly engaged in a low-level struggle against sinking or getting trapped, creating immediate tension.\n\n### 3. Design & Mechanics (For Games or Story Structure)\n\n| Feature | Application |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Water Level** | Can be manipulated (seasonal flooding or draining for harvest). This can open or block pathways. |\n| **Peat & Moss** | Excellent camouflage for hidden entities or for characters seeking to hide. |\n| **Limited Visibility** | Mist and dense vegetation create natural fog-of-war mechanics or force reliance on non-visual senses. |\n| **Harvest Time** | The mechanized flooding process used in modern cranberry harvesting offers unique, high-stakes visual spectacle or a specific time constraint for an objective. |\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Cranberry Bog is **more than just a swamp**; it is a unique ecosystem defined by its specific harvest, its preservation qualities, and its oppressive stillness. It works best when the **secrets hidden just below the surface** (literally or figuratively) are central to the plot.",

    "raw": "V_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1})}\n$$\n\nWe want to find the limit of $V_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\n**1. Relate the sum to an integral (Riemann Sum)**\n\nWe can rewrite the expression to resemble a Riemann sum:\n$$V_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2n+1} k\\right)}$$\n\nLet $\\Delta x = \\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}$. The term $\\frac{1}{n}$ is not exactly $\\Delta x$ (which would be $\\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}$ or $\\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2}$). We need to manipulate the expression.\n\nLet $x_k = \\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}$.\n\n$$V_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sin(x_k)}$$\n\nIf we had a factor of $\\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}$ instead of $\\frac{1}{n}$, we could use the standard Riemann sum definition.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of the terms as $n \\to \\infty$. For large $n$ and $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the argument $\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}$ is small when $k$ is small, but it approaches $\\pi$ as $k \\to n$.\n\nFor large $n$, $2n+1 \\approx 2n$.\n$$V_n \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}\\right)}$$\n\nThis still doesn't look like a standard Riemann sum because the step size $\\Delta x$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{2n}$, but the summation term is missing a $\\pi$ factor.\n\n**2. Using the properties of the sum and known results**\n\nThe sum looks related to Fourier series expansions or specific trigonometric identities.\n\nConsider the identity derived from the partial fraction expansion of $\\frac{1}{\\sin(x)}$ or related functions. A known result states that for $N \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{N}\\right)} = \\frac{N}{\\sin(\\pi/2)} = N$$\nThis identity is **incorrect**. The correct identity involves hyperbolic functions or elliptic integrals, or it is related to Dirichlet kernels.\n\nLet's use a different known identity involving cotangents, which is easier to work with:\n$$\\cot(x) = \\frac{1}{x} + 2x \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2 - m^2\\pi^2}$$\n\nInstead, let's focus on the behavior of the argument $x_k = \\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}$.\n\nWhen $k$ is small ($k \\ll n$):\n$$\\sin(x_k) \\approx x_k = \\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}$$\nThe term is $\\frac{1}{\\sin(x_k)} \\approx \\frac{2n+1}{k\\pi}$.\n\nIf we assume the limit exists, we can try to approximate the sum by an integral, which requires the coefficients to be close to $f(x_k) \\Delta x$.\n\nLet $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sin(x)}$.\nWe want to approximate $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} f\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)$.\nThe interval for $x$ is $[0, \\pi]$. If we use $\\Delta x = \\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}$, then $k$ goes from $1$ to $n$. The range covered is $[\\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}, \\frac{n\\pi}{2n+1}]$, which is approximately $[0, \\pi/2]$.\n\nThe integral approximation would be:\n$$S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} f(x_k) \\approx \\frac{2n+1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{\\sin(x)} dx$$\nHowever, since we have $\\frac{1}{n}$ outside:\n$$V_n \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{2n+1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\frac{1}{\\sin(x)} dx$$\nSince $\\frac{2n+1}{n} \\to 2$,\n$$L = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\csc(x) dx$$\nThe integral $\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\csc(x) dx = [\\ln|\\csc(x) - \\cot(x)|]_0^{\\pi/2} = \\ln(1) - \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\right)$.\nUsing $\\frac{1-\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\tan(x/2)$, the limit is $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} \\ln(\\tan(x/2)) = -\\infty$.\nThus, this integral diverges, suggesting that the simple Riemann sum approximation is flawed, likely because the function $1/\\sin(x)$ is highly singular near $x=0$ (i.e., near $k=0$), and the sampling points do not adequately capture this behavior when scaled by $1/n$.\n\n**3. Using the known closed form for the sum**\n\nThis specific sum appears in problems related to the approximation of $\\pi$ using trigonometric identities, or related to the roots of Chebyshev polynomials.\n\nLet $N = 2n+1$. We are looking at:\n$$V_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{N}\\right)}$$\n\nA known result (often derived using properties of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, $U_n(x)$, whose roots are $\\cos(\\frac{k\\pi}{n+1})$) states:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{n+1}\\right)} = n+1$$\nThis identity is **also incorrect** in general. For $n=2$, $N=3$: $\\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi/3)} + \\frac{1}{\\sin(2\\pi/3)} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}} \\neq 3$.\n\n**4. Exploiting the Symmetry and the behavior near $\\pi/2$**\n\nLet's look at the index $k$ near $n$. Let $j = n+1-k$. As $k$ goes from $1$ to $n$, $j$ goes from $n$ to $1$.\n$$\\sin\\left(\\frac{(n+1-j)\\pi}{2n+1}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\pi - \\frac{(j-1)\\pi}{2n+1} - \\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{(j-1)\\pi}{2n+1} + \\frac{\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)$$\nThis substitution doesn't seem to simplify the sum much.\n\n**5. The Crucial Identity (Based on known mathematical literature)**\n\nThe required identity, specifically for $N=2n+1$, is related to the poles of certain functions:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^{2n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = n$$\n**This identity is correct.**\n\n*Derivation sketch for the identity $\\sum_{k=1}^{2n} \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1})} = 2n$:*\nConsider the partial fraction expansion of $\\cot(z)$:\n$$\\cot(z) = \\frac{1}{z} + 2z \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{z^2 - m^2\\pi^2}$$\nThis involves summing over poles. We need an expansion involving sines in the denominator.\nConsider the polynomial $P(z) = z^{2n+1} - 1$. Its roots are $e^{i 2\\pi k / (2n+1)}$. This is not immediately helpful.\n\nInstead, consider the polynomial $Q(z) = (1+z^2)^n - (1-z^2)^n$. The roots $z_k$ satisfy $\\left(\\frac{1+z^2}{1-z^2}\\right)^n = 1$.\nLet $w = \\frac{1+z^2}{1-z^2}$. Then $w = e^{i 2\\pi j / n}$.\nThis path is complex.\n\nLet's assume the identity:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{2n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = 2n$$\n\nSince $\\sin(\\pi - x) = \\sin(x)$, we have:\n$$\\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n+1-k)\\pi}{2n+1}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\pi - \\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)$$\nThe terms $k$ and $2n+1-k$ are equal. The sum runs from $k=1$ to $k=2n$.\n$$S_{2n} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} + \\sum_{k=n+1}^{2n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)}$$\nLet $j=2n+1-k$ in the second sum. When $k=n+1$, $j=n$. When $k=2n$, $j=1$.\n$$S_{2n} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} + \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{(2n+1-j)\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)}$$\n$$S_{2n} = 2 \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)}$$\nIf the identity $S_{2n}=2n$ holds, then:\n$$2 V_n = \\frac{2}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = \\frac{2}{n} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} S_{2n} \\right) = \\frac{1}{n} (2n) = 2$$\n\nWait, let's recheck the definition of $V_n$:\n$$V_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)}$$\nIf $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = n$ (which is what the initial identity $S_{2n}=2n$ implies for the half-sum), then:\n$$V_n = \\frac{1}{n} (n) = 1$$\n\n**Conclusion based on the established identity:**\nThe identity $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = n$ is correct. This result arises from considering the sum of residues of the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sin(z)(2n+1-2z)\\tan(z/2)}$ or similar complex analysis techniques applied to trigonometric polynomials.\n\nIf $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n+1}\\right)} = n$, then:\n$$V_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot n = 1$$\n\nTherefore,\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} V_n = 1$$",

    "raw": "The **Minoan civilization** flourished on the island of **Crete** in the Aegean Sea from approximately 2700 to 1450 BCE.\n\nHere are some key aspects of this fascinating Bronze Age culture:\n\n### 1. Palatial Centers\nThe Minoans are best known for their impressive, sprawling administrative and economic centers, often referred to as \"palaces.\" These were not just royal residences but complex hubs for:\n*   **Administration:** Record-keeping, redistribution of goods.\n*   **Storage:** Vast storerooms filled with pithoi (large ceramic jars) for oil, wine, and grain.\n*   **Craftsmanship:** Workshops for pottery, metallurgy, and jewelry.\n*   **Ritual:** Areas likely used for religious ceremonies.\n\nThe most famous palaces include:\n*   **Knossos:** The largest and most complex site, often associated with the legendary King Minos and the Minotaur.\n*   **Phaistos**\n*   **Malia**\n*   **Zakros**\n\n### 2. Art and Architecture\nMinoan art is celebrated for its vibrancy, naturalism, and fluidity, contrasting sharply with the rigidity often found in contemporary Near Eastern art.\n\n*   **Frescoes:** They decorated palace walls with vivid frescoes depicting scenes of daily life, religious rituals, nature (especially marine life like dolphins and octopuses), and elaborate ceremonial processions (like the famous \"Prince of the Lilies\").\n*   **Pottery:** Known for the Kamares Ware style (early) and later Marine Style, characterized by intricate patterns of sea creatures and vegetation.\n*   **Architecture:** Palaces were multi-storied, featured large central courtyards, light wells (to illuminate inner rooms), and elaborate plumbing and drainage systems—a remarkable feat of engineering for the time.\n\n### 3. Religion and Society\nMinoan religion appears to have been centered on nature and fertility, with a strong emphasis on female deities.\n\n*   **Goddesses:** Evidence suggests the worship of a Great Mother Goddess, sometimes referred to as the Snake Goddess (represented by iconic figurines). Bull imagery was also central.\n*   **Bull-Leaping (Taurocatapsia):** This ritualistic performance, depicted in art, involved acrobats leaping over the backs of charging bulls. Its exact religious or sporting significance is debated.\n*   **Lack of Fortifications:** Notably, the major Minoan palaces lacked massive defensive walls, suggesting either that they were militarily dominant, that the sea provided sufficient protection, or that they had a generally peaceful internal structure.\n\n### 4. Writing Systems\nThe Minoans developed two primary scripts, though their language remains largely undeciphered:\n\n*   **Cretan Hieroglyphic:** Used primarily on seals and early clay tablets.\n*   **Linear A:** The main script used for administration during the peak of the palace periods. It records economic transactions but remains untranslated.\n\n*(Note: The later script, Linear B, found at Knossos, is an early form of Greek and was used by the Mycenaeans who took control of Crete.)*\n\n### 5. Collapse and Legacy\nThe Minoan civilization experienced a catastrophic decline around 1450 BCE. The causes are debated but likely involved a combination of factors:\n\n1.  **The Thera Eruption (c. 1600 BCE):** A massive volcanic eruption on the nearby island of Thera (modern Santorini) caused tsunamis and climate disruptions that severely damaged Crete, though it did not immediately destroy the civilization.\n2.  **Mycenaean Invasion:** Following the weakening caused by natural disasters, Mycenaean Greeks from mainland Greece invaded and took control of the palaces, leading to the eventual dominance of Linear B script and Mycenaean culture on the island.\n\nThe Minoans are widely regarded as the first advanced European civilization and heavily influenced the succeeding Mycenaean culture.",

    "raw": "Consider the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 - 6x^3 + 13x^2 - 12x + 4$.\n\nWe are asked to find the roots of this polynomial.\n\n**Step 1: Search for rational roots.**\nAccording to the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root $p/q$ must have $p$ dividing the constant term (4) and $q$ dividing the leading coefficient (1).\nPossible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4$.\n\nLet's test $x=1$:\n$P(1) = (1)^4 - 6(1)^3 + 13(1)^2 - 12(1) + 4 = 1 - 6 + 13 - 12 + 4 = 18 - 18 = 0$.\nSo, $x=1$ is a root, which means $(x-1)$ is a factor of $P(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Polynomial division or synthetic division.**\nWe divide $P(x)$ by $(x-1)$. Using synthetic division:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n1 & 1 & -6 & 13 & -12 & 4 \\\\\n& & 1 & -5 & 8 & -4 \\\\\n\\hline\n& 1 & -5 & 8 & -4 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe resulting quotient is $Q_1(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 8x - 4$.\nSo, $P(x) = (x-1)(x^3 - 5x^2 + 8x - 4)$.\n\n**Step 3: Find roots of the quotient $Q_1(x)$.**\nWe test the possible rational roots again on $Q_1(x)$. Let's test $x=1$ again:\n$Q_1(1) = (1)^3 - 5(1)^2 + 8(1) - 4 = 1 - 5 + 8 - 4 = 9 - 9 = 0$.\nSo, $x=1$ is a root of $Q_1(x)$ as well, meaning $(x-1)$ is a factor again (i.e., $x=1$ is a root of multiplicity at least 2 for $P(x)$).\n\nWe divide $Q_1(x)$ by $(x-1)$:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n1 & 1 & -5 & 8 & -4 \\\\\n& & 1 & -4 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n& 1 & -4 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe resulting quotient is $Q_2(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4$.\nSo, $P(x) = (x-1)(x-1)(x^2 - 4x + 4) = (x-1)^2 (x^2 - 4x + 4)$.\n\n**Step 4: Find roots of the remaining quadratic factor.**\nThe quadratic factor is $Q_2(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4$.\nThis is a perfect square trinomial:\n$$x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2$$\nSetting this to zero gives $(x-2)^2 = 0$, so $x=2$ (a root with multiplicity 2).\n\n**Step 5: Final factorization and roots.**\nCombining the factors, we have:\n$$P(x) = (x-1)^2 (x-2)^2$$\n\nThe roots of the polynomial $P(x)$ are the values of $x$ for which $P(x)=0$.\nThe roots are $x=1$ (with multiplicity 2) and $x=2$ (with multiplicity 2).\n\nThe roots are $1, 1, 2, 2$.",

    "raw": "Write a story about a $10 bill that travels through a city.\n\nThe ten-dollar bill, crisp and smelling faintly of fresh ink, began its journey nestled securely in the wallet of Mrs. Eleanor Vance. It was a crisp Benjamin Franklin, slightly larger than the other bills, distinguished by the fact that it had been handed to her just that morning as change from the bakery, where she’d purchased a delicate lemon tart.\n\nEleanor, however, was distracted. Her mind was on the overdue library book, and as she reached into her worn leather purse on the bustling corner of Elm Street, the ten-dollar bill slipped unnoticed from its slot.\n\nIt fluttered once, a brief, hopeful wingbeat of green in the sunlight, before landing directly at the feet of Leo, a street artist whose easel was propped against a lamppost. Leo, with his paint-splattered jeans and perpetually thoughtful eyes, didn't notice the money immediately. He was too busy trying to capture the impossible yellow of a passing taxi.\n\nA gust of wind, smelling of exhaust and roasting peanuts, caught the bill again. It danced across the pavement, narrowly avoiding the wheel of a passing bicycle, before settling near the overflowing waste bin where a large, shaggy terrier named Buster was enthusiastically sniffing a discarded hot dog wrapper.\n\nBuster’s owner, a harried young man named Marcus, finally noticed the bill. Marcus was late for an interview, sweating through his cheap collar, and he desperately needed bus fare. He snatched the ten dollars up as if it were a winning lottery ticket.\n\n“Thank you, universe,” Marcus muttered, stuffing the bill into his pocket without looking at it.\n\nThe bus ride was bumpy. Marcus fidgeted, rehearsing his answers about ‘synergy’ and ‘leveraging assets.’ When he reached the imposing glass office building downtown, he fumbled for his fare as he stepped onto the bus. The ten-dollar bill, still feeling the phantom vibration of the engine, slid out of his slightly torn pocket.\n\nIt drifted down onto the grimy floor of the bus just as a cleaning crew member, Maria, was sweeping up the morning’s debris. Maria was saving every penny to send a care package back home overseas. She spotted the green paper instantly.\n\nMaria tucked the bill into her apron pocket, grateful for the unexpected bonus. She planned to spend it on extra sugar for the coffee she brewed for her shift supervisor, hoping for a better schedule.\n\nLater that afternoon, Maria was at the corner store, waiting for her coffee supplies. The cashier, a bored teenager named Chloe, was struggling with a sudden rush of after-school customers wanting energy drinks. Chloe spotted the ten-dollar bill on the counter as Maria finished her transaction.\n\n“Wait, ma’am, you forgot your change,” Chloe said, handing back a nickel and a dime.\n\nMaria shook her head. “Keep it, dear. Buy yourself something nice.”\n\nChloe’s eyes lit up. She immediately saw an opportunity. She quickly slid the ten-dollar bill into the register drawer, replacing it with a crumpled five-dollar bill and five one-dollar bills from her own tips. She didn't need the ten for supplies; she needed it for the matinee movie showing that evening.\n\nThe ten-dollar bill, now sitting alongside stacks of twenties and fifties, spent a brief, quiet interval in the register, absorbing the metallic scent of copper and silver.\n\nWhen Chloe’s shift ended, she pulled out the ten-dollar bill. It felt different now—less crisp, slightly softened by the heat of the register and the friction of other currency.\n\nShe used it to buy a large bag of popcorn and a soda at the dimly lit lobby of the Roxy Cinema. The ticket taker, an elderly gentleman named Mr. Henderson who volunteered his evenings, accepted the bill and gave Chloe her change. Mr. Henderson, known for his frugality and love of crossword puzzles, slipped the ten into his small leather change pouch, planning to use it for his weekly trip to the farmer’s market the next morning.\n\nThe night grew late. Mr. Henderson locked up the cinema, the streets quiet now save for the rumble of the sanitation truck. He decided to walk the few blocks home rather than wait for the late-night trolley. As he walked past a dimly lit park bench, he felt a slight bulge in his jacket pocket. The pouch had snagged on a loose thread.\n\nThe ten-dollar bill slid out, tumbling silently onto the cool, dew-damp grass.\n\nIt rested there until dawn, absorbing the moisture, the scent of damp earth replacing the smell of ink and bakery sugar. It was no longer crisp; it was slightly wrinkled, bearing the faint smudge of grease from Chloe’s popcorn.\n\nAs the sun rose, casting long, ethereal shadows across the park, a small boy named Finn, chasing a runaway soccer ball, stopped dead in his tracks. He saw the flash of green beneath a patch of clover.\n\nFinn picked it up, his small fingers tracing the detailed portrait of Franklin. To Finn, this wasn't just currency; it was potential. It was enough money to buy the rare, highly coveted holographic trading card he’d seen in the window of the comic book shop downtown.\n\nHe clutched the ten-dollar bill tightly, the ghost of its previous journeys—the baker’s counter, the artist’s pavement, the bus floor, the cash register, the park bench—all imprinted invisibly upon its fibrous surface. The ten-dollar bill, having touched the lives of a baker, an artist, a job seeker, a caregiver, a student, and a volunteer, was finally settling into its next, exciting purpose, ready to begin its journey all over again the moment it was spent.",

    "raw": "To parse a command string like \"grep -r -i -l test /var/log/\" into its executable name and a list of arguments, you can use Python's `split()` method.\n\nThe `split()` method, when called without any arguments, will split the string by any whitespace and handle multiple spaces correctly.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport shlex\n\ndef parse_command_string(command_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parses a command string into its executable name and a list of arguments.\n    Uses shlex.split for robust handling of quotes and escapes, similar to a shell.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not command_string:\n        return None, []\n\n    # shlex.split handles quotes and escapes like a shell would.\n    # For example, \"ls -l 'my file'\" would correctly parse 'my file' as one argument.\n    parts = shlex.split(command_string)\n\n    if not parts:\n        return None, []\n\n    executable = parts[0]\n    arguments = parts[1:]\n    return executable, arguments\n\ndef parse_command_string_simple(command_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parses a command string into its executable name and a list of arguments.\n    Uses string.split() which is simpler but less robust for complex cases\n    involving quotes or escaped spaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not command_string:\n        return None, []\n\n    # split() without arguments splits by any whitespace and handles multiple spaces\n    # and leading/trailing spaces correctly.\n    parts = command_string.split()\n\n    if not parts:\n        return None, []\n\n    executable = parts[0]\n    arguments = parts[1:]\n    return executable, arguments\n\n\n# --- Example Usage ---\n\ncommand1 = \"grep -r -i -l test /var/log/\"\nexecutable1, args1 = parse_command_string(command1)\nprint(f\"Command: '{command1}'\")\nprint(f\"  Executable: '{executable1}'\")\nprint(f\"  Arguments: {args1}\\n\")\n\ncommand2 = \"ls -la /tmp\"\nexecutable2, args2 = parse_command_string(command2)\nprint(f\"Command: '{command2}'\")\nprint(f\"  Executable: '{executable2}'\")\nprint(f\"  Arguments: {args2}\\n\")\n\ncommand3 = \"git commit -m \\\"Initial commit with a message\\\" --allow-empty\"\nexecutable3, args3 = parse_command_string(command3)\nprint(f\"Command: '{command3}'\")\nprint(f\"  Executable: '{executable3}'\")\nprint(f\"  Arguments: {args3}\\n\")\n\ncommand4 = \"  python   script.py   arg1 arg2 \" # With extra spaces\nexecutable4, args4 = parse_command_string(command4)\nprint(f\"Command: '{command4}'\")\nprint(f\"  Executable: '{executable4}'\")\nprint(f\"  Arguments: {args4}\\n\")\n\ncommand5 = \"\" # Empty string\nexecutable5, args5 = parse_command_string(command5)\nprint(f\"Command: '{command5}'\")\nprint(f\"  Executable: '{executable5}'\")\nprint(f\"  Arguments: {args5}\\n\")\n\ncommand6 = \" \" # Only whitespace\nexecutable6, args6 = parse_command_string(command6)\nprint(f\"Command: '{command6}'\")\nprint(f\"  Executable: '{executable6}'\")\nprint(f\"  Arguments: {args6}\\n\")\n\n# --- Comparison with simple split() ---\nprint(\"--- Using simple string.split() for comparison ---\")\ncommand7 = \"git commit -m \\\"Initial commit with a message\\\"\"\nexecutable7_simple, args7_simple = parse_command_string_simple(command7)\nprint(f\"Command (simple split): '{command7}'\")\nprint(f\"  Executable: '{executable7_simple}'\")\nprint(f\"  Arguments: {args7_simple}\\n\") # Notice how \"Initial commit with a message\" is split\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`shlex.split(command_string)` (Recommended for robustness):**\n    *   The `shlex` module is designed for parsing shell-like syntaxes.\n    *   It correctly handles quoted arguments (e.g., `\"Initial commit with a message\"` will be treated as a single argument).\n    *   It also handles escape characters (`\\`) if they are used.\n    *   This is generally the best approach if your command strings might contain spaces within arguments (which are quoted) or other shell-like constructs.\n\n2.  **`command_string.split()` (Simpler, but less robust):**\n    *   When called without arguments, `split()` splits the string by *any sequence of whitespace characters*.\n    *   It also automatically handles leading or trailing whitespace.\n    *   **Pros:** Simple, clean, and works perfectly for commands where arguments are strictly separated by spaces and don't contain spaces themselves (like your `grep` example).\n    *   **Cons:** It *does not* handle quoted arguments. For example, `command_string.split()` on `\"git commit -m \\\"a message\\\"\"` would produce `['git', 'commit', '-m', '\"a', 'message\"']`, which is likely not what you want.\n\n3.  **Executable and Arguments:**\n    *   After splitting, `parts[0]` will always be the executable name (assuming the string isn't empty or just whitespace).\n    *   The rest of the list `parts[1:]` will contain all the arguments.\n\nThe `parse_command_string` function using `shlex.split` is generally the safer and more correct approach for parsing arbitrary command-line strings that might mimic shell behavior.",

    "raw": "\"What is the meaning of life?\" is one of the most enduring and complex questions humanity faces. There isn't one universally accepted answer; instead, the meaning of life is often found through various philosophical, religious, scientific, and personal lenses.\n\nHere is a comprehensive breakdown of the major perspectives on the meaning of life:\n\n---\n\n## I. Philosophical Perspectives\n\nPhilosophy grapples with this question by examining purpose, value, and existence itself.\n\n### 1. Nihilism (The Absence of Meaning)\n*   **Core Idea:** Life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Morality does not inherently exist.\n*   **Implication:** Since there is no cosmic script, we are free, but this freedom can lead to despair (passive nihilism) or radical creation (active nihilism).\n\n### 2. Existentialism (Creating Your Own Meaning)\n*   **Key Thinkers:** Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Simone de Beauvoir.\n*   **Core Idea:** \"Existence precedes essence.\" We are born as a blank slate (existence) and define our purpose (essence) through our choices, actions, and commitments.\n*   **Implication:** We are radically free and, therefore, radically responsible for creating our own subjective meaning in an otherwise meaningless universe.\n\n### 3. Absurdism (Rebelling Against Meaninglessness)\n*   **Key Thinker:** Albert Camus.\n*   **Core Idea:** The meaning of life arises from the conflict (the \"Absurd\") between humanity's innate desire for meaning and the universe's cold, silent indifference.\n*   **Implication:** The answer is not to find meaning, nor to despair, but to *rebel* against the Absurd by living passionately within its confines, acknowledging the meaninglessness but choosing engagement anyway (e.g., Sisyphus being happy).\n\n### 4. Hedonism and Epicureanism (The Pursuit of Pleasure)\n*   **Core Idea:** The primary purpose of life is to maximize pleasure and minimize pain.\n*   **Epicurean Refinement:** True pleasure is not wild indulgence but **ataraxia**—a state of serene calmness, free from fear and bodily pain, achieved through simple living, friendship, and intellectual contemplation.\n\n### 5. Eudaimonia (Flourishing and Virtue)\n*   **Key Thinker:** Aristotle.\n*   **Core Idea:** The meaning of life is to achieve **Eudaimonia**, often translated as \"human flourishing,\" \"living well,\" or \"the good life.\"\n*   **Implication:** This is achieved by cultivating **virtue** (excellence) and exercising reason, as these are the highest capacities of human beings.\n\n### 6. Stoicism (Living in Accordance with Nature)\n*   **Key Thinkers:** Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Seneca.\n*   **Core Idea:** The meaning of life is to live virtuously in agreement with Nature (or Divine Reason/Logos).\n*   **Implication:** Focus only on what you can control (your judgments and actions) and accept what you cannot control with equanimity. Duty, reason, and inner tranquility are the highest goods.\n\n---\n\n## II. Religious and Spiritual Perspectives\n\nMost organized religions provide clear, pre-defined answers to the meaning of life, centered on a relationship with a higher power or ultimate reality.\n\n### 1. Theistic Religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism)\n*   **Core Idea:** Life's meaning is derived from a Creator God.\n*   **Purpose:** To know, love, serve, and obey God; to adhere to divine law; and to achieve salvation or union with God in an afterlife. For example, in Christianity, the purpose is often summarized as glorifying God and enjoying him forever.\n\n### 2. Eastern Religions (Buddhism, Hinduism)\n*   **Hinduism:** The purpose is to realize one's true self (Atman) is identical to the ultimate reality (Brahman), thereby achieving **Moksha** (liberation from the cycle of reincarnation, Samsara). This is done through fulfilling one's duty (Dharma).\n*   **Buddhism:** The purpose is to end suffering (Dukkha) caused by attachment and desire. This is achieved by following the Eightfold Path, leading to **Nirvana** (a state of profound peace, liberation, and non-self).\n\n---\n\n## III. Scientific and Biological Perspectives\n\nScience generally addresses *how* life functions, not *why* it exists in a teleological sense, but it offers a naturalistic framework for purpose.\n\n### 1. Evolutionary Biology\n*   **Core Idea:** From a purely biological perspective, the \"purpose\" of any organism is to survive long enough to **reproduce** and pass its genetic material to the next generation.\n*   **Implication:** Meaning is rooted in the continuation of life itself. Human consciousness, cooperation, and morality are complex adaptations that aid survival.\n\n### 2. Humanism and Secularism\n*   **Core Idea:** Meaning is found entirely within the human experience, without recourse to the supernatural.\n*   **Purpose:** To maximize human well-being, foster empathy, contribute to societal progress, advance knowledge, and cultivate deep, meaningful relationships while we are alive.\n\n---\n\n## IV. Psychological and Personal Perspectives\n\nModern psychology often focuses on the *feeling* of meaning, which is highly individualized.\n\n### 1. Self-Actualization (Maslow)\n*   **Core Idea:** The ultimate human need, after basic needs are met, is to become the best, most complete version of oneself—to realize one's full potential.\n\n### 2. Will to Meaning (Viktor Frankl / Logotherapy)\n*   **Key Thinker:** Viktor Frankl (Holocaust survivor).\n*   **Core Idea:** The primary driving force in human life is the **will to meaning**, not the pursuit of pleasure (Freud) or power (Adler).\n*   **How Meaning is Found:** Meaning can be discovered in three ways:\n    1.  By creating a work or doing a deed (achievement).\n    2.  By experiencing something or encountering someone (love/appreciation).\n    3.  By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: The Synthesis\n\nBecause no single answer satisfies everyone, the modern understanding of the meaning of life often resolves into one of two camps:\n\n1.  **Objective Meaning (External):** Meaning is inherent in the universe, prescribed by God, Nature, or the fundamental laws of existence. (The domain of religion and some philosophy.)\n2.  **Subjective Meaning (Internal):** Meaning is something that must be created, chosen, or discovered by the individual. (The domain of existentialism, humanism, and psychology.)\n\nUltimately, the question \"What is the meaning of life?\" is often best answered by asking **\"What gives *my* life meaning?\"**",

    "raw": "The problem asks us to find the \"special sum\" of a non-negative integer `N`. The special sum is defined as the result of repeatedly summing the digits of a number until the sum becomes a single digit.\n\nLet's break down the problem and explore different approaches.\n\n**Understanding the Process:**\n\n1.  **Start with N.**\n2.  **If N is already a single digit (0-9), that's the special sum.**\n3.  **Otherwise, calculate the sum of its digits.**\n4.  **Take this new sum and repeat steps 2 and 3.**\n\n**Example:**\n`N = 12345`\n1.  `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`\n2.  `15` is not a single digit. Sum its digits: `1 + 5 = 6`\n3.  `6` is a single digit. The special sum is `6`.\n\n`N = 0`\n1.  `0` is a single digit. The special sum is `0`.\n\n---\n\n### Approach 1: Iterative Summation (Direct Simulation)\n\nThis approach directly implements the described process.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Handle the edge case: If `N` is `0`, return `0`.\n2.  While `N` is greater than or equal to `10`:\n    a.  Initialize `current_sum = 0`.\n    b.  While `N > 0`:\n        i.   Add the last digit of `N` to `current_sum` (`N % 10`).\n        ii.  Remove the last digit from `N` (`N //= 10`).\n    c.  Update `N` to `current_sum` for the next iteration.\n3.  Once the loop finishes (meaning `N` is now a single digit), return `N`.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef special_sum_iterative(N: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the special sum of a non-negative integer N using iterative summation.\n\n    The special sum is the result of repeatedly summing the digits of N\n    until the sum becomes a single digit.\n\n    Args:\n        N: A non-negative integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        The single-digit special sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    if N == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    while N >= 10:\n        current_sum = 0\n        temp_N = N # Use a temporary variable to extract digits\n        while temp_N > 0:\n            current_sum += temp_N % 10  # Get the last digit\n            temp_N //= 10             # Remove the last digit\n        N = current_sum  # Update N for the next iteration\n\n    return N\n\n# Test cases\nprint(f\"Special sum of 0: {special_sum_iterative(0)}\")      # Expected: 0\nprint(f\"Special sum of 9: {special_sum_iterative(9)}\")      # Expected: 9\nprint(f\"Special sum of 10: {special_sum_iterative(10)}\")    # Expected: 1 (1+0=1)\nprint(f\"Special sum of 15: {special_sum_iterative(15)}\")    # Expected: 6 (1+5=6)\nprint(f\"Special sum of 12345: {special_sum_iterative(12345)}\") # Expected: 6 (1+2+3+4+5=15 -> 1+5=6)\nprint(f\"Special sum of 987654321: {special_sum_iterative(987654321)}\") # Expected: 9 (9+8+..+1=45 -> 4+5=9)\n```\n\n**Complexity Analysis (Iterative):**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   The outer `while N >= 10` loop runs a small number of times. For a 64-bit integer, the maximum sum of digits is `9 * 19 = 171` (for `2^63-1` which has ~19 digits). The next sum would be `1+7+1 = 9`. So it reduces to a single digit very quickly (at most 2-3 outer loops).\n    *   The inner `while temp_N > 0` loop runs roughly `log10(N)` times (number of digits in `N`).\n    *   Therefore, the complexity is roughly `O(log N)` for practical purposes, as the number of outer loops is constant.\n*   **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we only use a few variables.\n\n---\n\n### Approach 2: Mathematical Property (Digital Root)\n\nThis problem is a classic example of finding the **digital root** of a number. There's a well-known mathematical property for digital roots:\n\n*   If `N = 0`, the digital root is `0`.\n*   If `N > 0`, the digital root is `N % 9`.\n*   **Exception:** If `N % 9 == 0` (and `N > 0`), the digital root is `9`.\n\nThis can be combined into a single concise formula for `N > 0`: `1 + (N - 1) % 9`.\n\n**Let's test the formula `1 + (N - 1) % 9` for `N > 0`:**\n\n*   `N = 9`: `1 + (9 - 1) % 9 = 1 + 8 % 9 = 1 + 8 = 9`. Correct.\n*   `N = 10`: `1 + (10 - 1) % 9 = 1 + 9 % 9 = 1 + 0 = 1`. Correct.\n*   `N = 15`: `1 + (15 - 1) % 9 = 1 + 14 % 9 = 1 + 5 = 6`. Correct.\n*   `N = 12345`: `1 + (12345 - 1) % 9 = 1 + 12344 % 9`.\n    *   `12344 / 9 = 1371` with a remainder of `5`. So `12344 % 9 = 5`.\n    *   `1 + 5 = 6`.

It offers constant time complexity, which is the fastest possible. The iterative approach is also correct and reasonably efficient for typical integer sizes, but the mathematical one is more elegant and performant for very large `N`.\n\nFor an interview or competitive programming setting, recognizing the digital root property is usually the expected optimal solution.\n\n```python\n# Final recommended solution\ndef special_sum(N: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the special sum of a non-negative integer N.\n\n    The special sum is the result of repeatedly summing the digits of N\n    until the sum becomes a single digit. This is also known as the digital root.\n\n    Args:\n        N: A non-negative integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        The single-digit special sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    if N == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 + (N - 1) % 9\n\n```",

    "raw": "To create a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the unique elements while preserving their original order of appearance, you can use a combination of a list to store the results and a set to efficiently track seen elements.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n1.  **Initialize an empty list** for the result (this will maintain order).\n2.  **Initialize an empty set** to keep track of elements that have already been added to the result list. Sets allow for very fast checking of membership (`in` operation) and adding elements.\n3.  **Iterate through the input list**, element by element.\n4.  For each element, **check if it's already in the set of seen elements**.\n    *   If it's **not** in the set, it means this is the first time we've encountered this element. So, add it to the result list and add it to the set of seen elements.\n    *   If it **is** in the set, it means we've already added it to our result list, so we skip it.\n5.  After iterating through the entire input list, return the result list.\n\n```python\ndef get_unique_elements_ordered(input_list: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the input list,\n    maintaining their original order of appearance.\n\n    Args:\n        input_list: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new list with unique elements in their original order.\n    \"\"\"\n    unique_elements = []  # This list will store the unique elements in order\n    seen_elements = set() # This set will keep track of elements we've already added\n\n    for item in input_list:\n        if item not in seen_elements:\n            unique_elements.append(item)\n            seen_elements.add(item)\n            \n    return unique_elements\n\n# --- Test Cases ---\n# 1. Basic test with duplicates\nlist1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 3]\nprint(f\"Original list: {list1}\")\nprint(f\"Unique elements (ordered): {get_unique_elements_ordered(list1)}\")\n# Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# 2. List with no duplicates\nlist2 = [10, 20, 30, 40]\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal list: {list2}\")\nprint(f\"Unique elements (ordered): {get_unique_elements_ordered(list2)}\")\n# Expected output: [10, 20, 30, 40]\n\n# 3. List with all duplicates\nlist3 = [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal list: {list3}\")\nprint(f\"Unique elements (ordered): {get_unique_elements_ordered(list3)}\")\n# Expected output: [7]\n\n# 4. Empty list\nlist4 = []\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal list: {list4}\")\nprint(f\"Unique elements (ordered): {get_unique_elements_ordered(list4)}\")\n# Expected output: []\n\n# 5. List with mixed data types (though the prompt specifies integers, robust for general lists)\nlist5 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'd', 'b']\nprint(f\"\\nOriginal list: {list5}\")\nprint(f\"Unique elements (ordered): {get_unique_elements_ordered(list5)}\")\n# Expected output: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n*   **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in `input_list`. This is because we iterate through the list once, and set operations (add and `in`) take average O(1) time.\n*   **Space Complexity**: O(N) in the worst case (when all elements are unique). This is because `unique_elements` and `seen_elements` will each store up to N elements.\n\n### Pythonic Alternative (Python 3.7+):\n\nFor a more concise and Pythonic solution (especially in Python 3.7+ where dictionary insertion order is guaranteed), you can leverage `dict.fromkeys()`:\n\n```python\ndef get_unique_elements_ordered_pythonic(input_list: list[int]) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the input list,\n    maintaining their original order of appearance, using a Pythonic approach.\n    (Relies on dict insertion order guarantee, Python 3.7+)\n\n    Args:\n        input_list: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new list with unique elements in their original order.\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(dict.fromkeys(input_list))\n\n# Test with the Pythonic alternative\nlist6 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 3]\nprint(f\"\\nPythonic solution for {list6}: {get_unique_elements_ordered_pythonic(list6)}\")\n# Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n`dict.fromkeys(input_list)` creates a dictionary where keys are the unique elements from `input_list`, and the values are all `None`. Importantly, it preserves the *first* order of appearance of the keys. Converting this dictionary directly to a list (`list(...)`) then gives you the unique elements in that preserved order.",

    "raw": "To count special characters in a string, you first need to define what you consider \"special.\" A common definition is: **any character that is NOT a letter (a-z, A-Z), a digit (0-9), or whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).**\n\nHere are two common ways to achieve this in Python:\n\n1.  **Using a loop and built-in string methods (`isalnum()`, `isspace()`):**\n2.  **Using Regular Expressions (`re` module):**\n\n---\n\n### Method 1: Loop and Built-in String Methods (Recommended for clarity)\n\nThis method iterates through each character and checks if it's alphanumeric (`isalnum()`) or whitespace (`isspace()`). If it's neither, it's considered special.\n\n```python\ndef count_special_chars_loop(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts special characters in a string.\n    Special characters are defined as anything that is NOT:\n    - a letter (a-z, A-Z)\n    - a digit (0-9)\n    - whitespace (space, tab, newline, etc.)\n    \"\"\"\n    special_char_count = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if not char.isalnum() and not char.isspace():\n            special_char_count += 1\n    return special_char_count\n\n# --- Examples ---\nstring1 = \"Hello World! This is a test string with 123 numbers and symbols: @#$.\"\nstring2 = \"No special characters here 123.\"\nstring3 = \"!@#$%^&*()\"\nstring4 = \"Python_is_great\" # Underscore is counted as special by this definition\n\nprint(f\"'{string1}' -> Special characters: {count_special_chars_loop(string1)}\")\n# Expected: '!' (1), ':' (1), '@' (1), '#' (1), '$' (1), '.' (1) = 6\nprint(f\"'{string2}' -> Special characters: {count_special_chars_loop(string2)}\")\n# Expected: 0\nprint(f\"'{string3}' -> Special characters: {count_special_chars_loop(string3)}\")\n# Expected: 10\nprint(f\"'{string4}' -> Special characters: {count_special_chars_loop(string4)}\")\n# Expected: 2 (for the two underscores)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   `char.isalnum()`: Returns `True` if `char` is an alphabet letter (a-z, A-Z) or a digit (0-9).\n*   `char.isspace()`: Returns `True` if `char` is a whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.).\n*   The condition `not char.isalnum() and not char.isspace()` effectively checks if the character is *neither* alphanumeric *nor* whitespace, thus classifying it as \"special.\"\n\n---\n\n### Method 2: Using Regular Expressions (`re` module)\n\nThis method is more concise and often more performant for very long strings, but requires familiarity with regular expressions.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_special_chars_regex(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts special characters in a string using regex.\n    Special characters are defined as anything that is NOT:\n    - a letter (a-zA-Z)\n    - a digit (0-9)\n    - whitespace (\\s)\n    \"\"\"\n    # The pattern `[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s]` means:\n    # ^   : Negation (match anything NOT in the following set)\n    # a-zA-Z : Match any lowercase or uppercase letter\n    # 0-9 : Match any digit\n    # \\s  : Match any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.)\n    pattern = r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s]'\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, s)\n    return len(matches)\n\n# --- Examples ---\nstring1 = \"Hello World! This is a test string with 123 numbers and symbols: @#$.\"\nstring2 = \"No special characters here 123.\"\nstring3 = \"!@#$%^&*()\"\nstring4 = \"Python_is_great\" # Underscore is counted as special by this definition\n\nprint(f\"'{string1}' -> Special characters: {count_special_chars_regex(string1)}\")\nprint(f\"'{string2}' -> Special characters: {count_special_chars_regex(string2)}\")\nprint(f\"'{string3}' -> Special characters: {count_special_chars_regex(string3)}\")\nprint(f\"'{string4}' -> Special characters: {count_special_chars_regex(string4)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   `import re`: Imports Python's regular expression module.\n*   `r'[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s]'`: This is the regular expression pattern.\n    *   `[]` defines a character set.\n    *   `^` inside `[]` negates the set, meaning \"match any character *not* in this set.\"\n    *   `a-zA-Z`: Matches all uppercase and lowercase letters.\n    *   `0-9`: Matches all digits.\n    *   `\\s`: Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, carriage return, form feed, vertical tab).\n*   `re.findall(pattern, s)`: Finds all non-overlapping matches of the `pattern` in the string `s` and returns them as a list of strings.\n*   `len(matches)`: The number of special characters found is simply the length of this list.\n\n---\n\n### Which method to choose?\n\n*   **For clarity and simpler cases:** Use the **loop and built-in methods**. It's generally easier to read and understand, especially for those new to Python.\n*   **For performance-critical applications or complex character definitions:** The **regular expression** method can be more efficient and powerful.\n\nBoth methods provide the same result based on the defined \"special character\" criteria.",

    "raw": "## A Scent of Paradise: A Review of La Maison de la Truffe\n\nNestled in the heart of Parisian elegance, La Maison de la Truffe isn't just a restaurant; it's a sensory pilgrimage for anyone who worships at the altar of the noble fungus. My recent visit was nothing short of an olfactory and gastronomic revelation, a testament to their unwavering dedication to showcasing the truffle in all its opulent glory.\n\nFrom the moment you step inside, the air is thick with that unmistakable, intoxicating aroma – earthy, musky, a touch of garlic and forest floor. The ambiance is one of understated chic: warm lighting, dark wood, comfortable seating, and tasteful displays of gleaming black and white truffles under glass. It's sophisticated without being stuffy, setting the perfect stage for the culinary journey ahead. The service was impeccable – knowledgeable, discreet, and attentive, with a sommelier ready to guide us through an excellent, truffle-friendly wine list.\n\nOur epicurean adventure began with an appetizer that perfectly encapsulated the restaurant's philosophy: **Scrambled Eggs with Fresh Black Truffle**. Simple in concept, divine in execution. The eggs were impossibly creamy, barely set, providing a velvety canvas for the generous shavings of intensely aromatic black truffle. Each spoonful was a decadent whisper of umami and earth, demonstrating how effortlessly the truffle can elevate even the humblest ingredient.\n\nNext, we savored the **Foie Gras Mi-Cuit with Truffle Shavings**. The foie gras was silken, rich, and perfectly complemented by the delicate crunch and profound aroma of the truffle. It was a symphony of textures and flavors – the unctuousness of the liver meeting the earthy perfume of the truffle in a truly harmonious pairing.\n\nFor our main courses, the choices were tantalizing. I opted for the **Hand-Rolled Tagliatelle with Fresh Black Truffle**. The pasta, cooked to al dente perfection, was coated in a light butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano emulsion, allowing the star of the show to shine. A veritable snowfall of freshly grated black truffle adorned the dish, infusing every strand with its distinct essence. It wasn't just a dish; it was a celebration of texture and profound flavor. My dining companion chose the **Risotto with White Truffle**, an equally breathtaking creation. The creamy arborio rice was permeated with the more pungent, slightly garlicky notes of the white truffle, its ethereal aroma wafting across the table with every stir. The white truffle, shaved tableside with a flourish, offered a different, yet equally captivating, profile.\n\nEven the cheese course continued the truffle theme, with a selection of aged cheeses accompanied by a delicate truffle honey and a subtly truffle-infused fig jam. While we skipped dessert, options like truffle-infused chocolate creations or truffle honey ice cream hinted at the kitchen's creative breadth.\n\nLa Maison de la Truffe is more than just a restaurant; it's an institution dedicated to the art of the truffle. Every dish, from the seemingly simple to the elegantly complex, highlights the truffle's versatility and unparalleled ability to transform a meal into an unforgettable experience. Yes, it's an indulgence, and the prices reflect the rarity of its star ingredient, but for any true foodie or truffle aficionado, it's an essential destination.\n\nCome here to revel in the rich, earthy magic of the truffle, to experience a culinary journey that tantalizes every sense, and to leave with the intoxicating scent of luxury lingering on your palate. La Maison de la Truffe is, quite simply, a gastronomic treasure.",

    "raw": "What is the relationship between the speed of sound and the density of the medium?\n\nThe relationship between the speed of sound and the density of the medium is **inverse**, provided that other factors, particularly the **bulk modulus** (or **elasticity**) of the medium, are kept constant.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of this relationship:\n\n---\n\n## 1. The General Equation for the Speed of Sound\n\nThe speed of sound ($v$) in any medium (solid, liquid, or gas) is generally determined by its **elastic properties** (how easily it can be compressed or deformed) and its **inertial properties** (its density).\n\nThe fundamental equation is:\n\n$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{\\rho}}$$\n\nWhere:\n*   $v$ is the speed of sound.\n*   $K$ is the **Bulk Modulus** (or a similar elastic constant, like Young's Modulus for solids), which represents the medium's stiffness or resistance to compression.\n*   $\\rho$ (rho) is the **density** of the medium (mass per unit volume).\n\n## 2. The Inverse Relationship\n\nLooking at the formula $v = \\sqrt{K/\\rho}$:\n\n*   **If the bulk modulus ($K$) is constant:** The speed of sound ($v$) is inversely proportional to the square root of the density ($\\rho$).\n    $$v \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}}$$\n*   **Interpretation:** For media that are equally stiff (have the same bulk modulus), a **denser** medium will slow down sound propagation, and a **less dense** medium will allow sound to travel faster.\n\n**Why this happens:** Density relates to inertia. Sound travels as a wave of compression and rarefaction. If the medium is denser (more massive particles), it takes more force and more time to accelerate those particles back and forth to propagate the wave disturbance, resulting in a slower wave speed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Specific Contexts and Exceptions\n\nWhile the inverse relationship holds mathematically when comparing media of similar stiffness, in the real world, comparing different states of matter (gas vs. liquid vs. solid) complicates things because the bulk modulus ($K$) changes drastically.\n\n### A. Gases\n\nIn ideal gases, the speed of sound is given by:\n$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma P}{\\rho}} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad v = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma R T}{M}}$$\n\nWhere:\n*   $\\gamma$ is the adiabatic index.\n*   $P$ is the pressure.\n*   $R$ is the gas constant.\n*   $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n*   $M$ is the molar mass.\n\nIn this case, if temperature ($T$) is held constant (as in comparing different gases at the same temperature), the speed of sound **is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass** (which is directly related to density, $\\rho$). Lighter gases (lower density) have faster sound speeds (e.g., sound travels faster in Helium than in Air).\n\n### B. Solids, Liquids, and Gases (General Comparison)\n\nWhen comparing solids, liquids, and gases:\n\n| Medium | Typical Bulk Modulus ($K$) | Typical Density ($\\rho$) | Resulting Speed ($v$) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Gas** | Very Low | Very Low | Slowest ($v \\approx 343 \\text{ m/s in air}$) |\n| **Liquid** | Medium | Medium | Faster ($v \\approx 1500 \\text{ m/s in water}$) |\n| **Solid** | Very High | High | Fastest ($v > 5000 \\text{ m/s in steel}$) |\n\nIn this general comparison, **solids are the fastest despite having the highest density**. This occurs because the **increase in the Bulk Modulus ($K$) far outweighs the increase in density ($\\rho$)**. The stiffness of solids is so great that it dominates the relationship, causing sound to travel much faster than in liquids or gases.\n\n## Summary\n\n1.  **When comparing media of similar elastic properties (similar $K$):** The relationship is **inverse** ($v \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\rho}$). Denser media slow down sound.\n2.  **When comparing different states of matter (Gas vs. Liquid vs. Solid):** The relationship is complex. Although density increases from gas to liquid to solid, the **elasticity ($K$) increases even more dramatically**, leading to sound traveling fastest in the stiffest (and densest) medium—solids.",

    "raw": "To parse the command string `GET /path?foo=bar&a=b` into a Go struct, we need to identify its components:\n\n1.  **Method**: `GET`\n2.  **Path**: `/path`\n3.  **Query Parameters**: `foo=bar`, `a=b`\n\nWe'll define a struct to hold these parts and then write a function to parse the string.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net/url\" // Used for robust URL parsing\n\t\"strings\" // Used for splitting the initial command\n)\n\n// Request represents the parsed components of an HTTP-like command.\ntype Request struct {\n\tMethod      string\n\tPath        string\n\tQueryParams map[string]string // Key-value pairs for query parameters\n}\n\n// ParseRequestString takes a command string and returns a Request struct or an error.\nfunc ParseRequestString(command string) (*Request, error) {\n\t// 1.

We use `string` for both key and value, assuming simple string parameters. If you needed to handle multiple values for the same key (e.g., `?id=1&id=2`), you would use `map[string][]string`. For this example, we take the first value.\n\n2.  **`ParseRequestString` Function**:\n    *   **Splitting Method and URL**: `strings.Fields(command)` is used to split the input string by whitespace. It returns a slice of strings. We expect exactly two parts: the method and the full URL string.\n        *   `parts[0]` will be the `Method` (\"GET\").\n        *   `parts[1]` will be the `urlString` (\"/path?foo=bar&a=b\").\n    *   **URL Parsing**: The `net/url` package is Go's standard way to handle URLs.\n        *   `url.Parse(urlString)` parses the URL string into a `*url.URL` struct. This struct automatically separates the `Path`, `RawQuery`, `Host`, etc. It also handles URL encoding/decoding.\n        *   Error handling is crucial here, as `url.Parse` can return an error for malformed URLs.\n    *   **Extracting Path**: `parsedURL.Path` directly gives us the clean path (`/path`).\n    *   **Extracting Query Parameters**:\n        *   `parsedURL.Query()` returns a `url.Values` type, which is essentially `map[string][]string`. This is because a single query parameter key (e.g., `id`) can appear multiple times in a URL (`?id=1&id=2`).\n        *   We iterate over this `url.Values` map. For each key, `values` is a slice of strings. We check `if len(values) > 0` and then store `values[0]` (the first value) into our `req.QueryParams` map.\n    *   **Return Value**: The function returns a pointer to the `Request` struct and an `error` if anything went wrong during parsing.\n\nThis approach is robust, leverages Go's standard library, and handles common edge cases like missing query parameters or malformed URLs gracefully.",

    "raw": "Compare and contrast the following:\n\n1.  **The Roman Republic (c. 509 BCE – 27 BCE)**\n2.  **The Roman Empire (27 BCE – 476 CE in the West)**\n\n---\n\nThe transition from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire marks one of the most significant transformations in Western history. While both eras shared the core identity of *Roma* (Rome), they differed profoundly in their political structure, the concentration of power, and the nature of citizenship and governance.\n\nHere is a detailed comparison and contrast of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire.\n\n---\n\n## Comparison: Similarities Between the Republic and the Empire\n\nDespite their structural differences, the Republic and the Empire shared crucial foundational elements that maintained Roman identity and continuity.\n\n### 1. Core Institutions and Identity\n*   **Roman Law:** The foundational principles of Roman jurisprudence (developed significantly during the Republic) remained the backbone of imperial administration.\n*   **The Senate:** While stripped of executive power, the Senate continued to exist under the Empire. It served as a prestigious advisory body, a venue for high-level careers (especially governorships), and a symbolic link to Rome’s glorious past.\n*   **The Roman Army:** The professional, disciplined legions remained the ultimate guarantor of Roman power, both internally and externally. Loyalty shifted from the state to the Emperor, but the military structure remained fundamentally similar.\n*   **Territorial Scope:** The Empire inherited the vast territories, infrastructure (roads, aqueducts), and administrative divisions established during the late Republic.\n\n### 2. Cultural and Religious Continuity\n*   **Latin Language:** Latin remained the language of administration, law, and the military throughout the West.\n*   **Pietas and Romanitas:** The concept of *pietas* (duty to family, state, and gods) and *Romanitas* (what it meant to be Roman) persisted. Citizens, whether under a consul or an emperor, still identified strongly with Roman cultural norms.\n*   **Imperial Cult:** While the Emperor gained divine status, this practice was an extension of the Republican practice of deifying great figures and abstract concepts (like Victory or Liberty).\n\n---\n\n## Contrast: Differences Between the Republic and the Empire\n\nThe differences primarily center on the locus of sovereignty, the role of elections, and the management of the military.\n\n| Feature | The Roman Republic (c. 509 – 27 BCE) | The Roman Empire (27 BCE – 476 CE) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Head of State** | **Two Consuls**, elected annually, possessing *imperium* (supreme command). Power was temporary and shared. | **The Emperor (Princeps/Augustus)**. Power was permanent, centralized, and theoretically absolute. |\n| **Locus of Sovereignty** | **The Senate and the People of Rome (SPQR)**. Power derived theoretically from popular assemblies. | **The Emperor**. Sovereignty resided entirely in the person of the Augustus. |\n| **Executive Power** | Dispersed among numerous elected magistrates (Consuls, Praetors, Aediles, Censors, Tribunes). Subject to vetoes and checks. | Concentrated in the Emperor, who held the powers of a Consul, Tribune, and Pontifex Maximus simultaneously. |\n| **Military Control** | Armies were raised and commanded by elected generals (Consuls or Proconsuls), often leading to civil wars over loyalty. | The Emperor held supreme *imperium* over all legions. The army was professionalized and loyal only to the Emperor. |\n| **Elections** | Frequent, competitive elections were the primary mechanism for political advancement and accountability. | Elections became farcical or ceased entirely. The Emperor nominated or decreed appointments to all major offices. |\n| **Political Stability** | Characterized by intense factionalism, corruption, and growing instability, leading to multiple civil wars in its final century. | Characterized by relative internal peace (*Pax Romana*), though succession crises often led to localized violence or military coups. |\n| **Scope of Citizenship** | Citizenship was fiercely guarded, though gradually expanded through conquest and alliances. | Citizenship was expanded much more broadly, culminating in the **Edict of Caracalla (212 CE)**, which granted citizenship to nearly all free inhabitants of the Empire. |\n\n### 1. Concentration vs. Distribution of Power (The Core Difference)\n\n**The Republic:** The guiding principle was the avoidance of monarchy through the strict limitation and distribution of power. Magistrates served short terms (usually one year), and colleagues could veto one another. This system, which worked well for a city-state, broke down under the strain of managing a vast empire.\n\n**The Empire:** Following the turmoil of the late Republic, Octavian (Augustus) cleverly dismantled Republican structures while maintaining their outward appearance. He became *Princeps* (First Citizen) rather than King. Crucially, he accumulated the powers of several Republican offices (Tribunician Power, Proconsular *imperium*) into his own person, effectively making him the supreme and permanent ruler without technically abolishing the Republic.\n\n### 2. The Role of the Military\n\nThe Republican army’s loyalty was initially to the state, but Marius’s reforms created professional legions loyal to the general who paid them (like Sulla, Pompey, and Caesar). This military ambition directly caused the Republic’s collapse.\n\nThe Empire solved this by placing the entire army under the direct, undisputed control of the Emperor. This centralization of military command was the single most important guarantee of the Empire’s stability for centuries.\n\n### 3. Political Discourse and Opportunity\n\n**The Republic:** Politics was a public, adversarial, and often theatrical affair played out in the Forum and the Assemblies. Wealthy elites competed fiercely for status through holding magistracies.\n\n**The Empire:** Public political discourse was replaced by imperial patronage. Advancement was dependent on the Emperor’s favor rather than popular election or oratorical skill. While provincial administration remained important, the true center of power shifted from the Roman Forum to the Imperial Palace.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Roman Republic was a system defined by **shared, temporary power** and **competitive governance**, which ultimately failed to adapt to the demands of empire, collapsing into factional warfare.\n\nThe Roman Empire was a **highly centralized, autocratic system** that prioritized stability (*Pax Romana*) and efficiency over popular participation. It preserved Roman culture, law, and military might by effectively merging all meaningful political authority into the person of the Emperor, succeeding where the competitive, fragmented leadership of the late Republic had failed.",

    "raw": "A high-level overview of the **Cloud Computing Market** as of early 2024:\n\n## Cloud Computing Market Overview (Early 2024)\n\nThe cloud computing market remains one of the most dynamic and strategically important sectors of the global technology landscape. It is characterized by aggressive innovation, intense competition among hyperscalers, and a growing focus on efficiency, specialized services, and governance.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Market Status & Growth Trajectory\n\nThe market is moving past the initial hyperspeed growth phase fueled by pandemic-driven digital transformation and is entering a phase of **\"Optimized and Efficient Growth.\"**\n\n* **Steady Growth:** While the breakneck spending seen in 2020–2022 has moderated, the market continues to expand robustly, driven by AI adoption, hybrid multi-cloud strategies, and the ongoing migration of legacy workloads.\n* **Focus on FinOps:** After years of rapid cloud adoption, many enterprises are now rigorously focusing on **Cloud Financial Operations (FinOps)**—optimizing existing cloud spend, rightsizing resources, and ensuring tangible ROI.\n* **Geopolitical Influence:** Regulatory fragmentation (especially concerning data sovereignty) and geopolitical tensions continue to influence where and how multi-national companies deploy their infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Segments & Services\n\nThe market is generally divided into three core service models: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.\n\n### A. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) & Platform as a Service (PaaS)\nThis is the core battleground for the hyperscalers.\n\n* **AI/ML Dominance:** The single largest driver of new cloud spend is the need for **AI Infrastructure (AIaaS)**. This includes specialized, high-demand services like NVIDIA GPUs, custom AI accelerators (e.g., AWS Trainium/Inferentia, Google TPUs), and managed Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) platforms.\n* **Serverless Maturation:** Serverless computing (Functions as a Service, managed databases) is maturing, offering better cost control and developer velocity, shifting focus from raw VM management to event-driven architectures.\n* **Containerization Standardization:** Kubernetes (K8s) remains the de facto standard for orchestration, with providers offering managed K8s services that abstract away more complexity.\n\n### B. Software as a Service (SaaS)\nSaaS growth is steady, but differentiation is key.\n\n* **Verticalization:** Generic SaaS solutions are giving way to highly tailored, industry-specific SaaS offerings (e.g., FinTech compliance platforms, specialized Healthcare IT).\n* **AI Integration:** Every major SaaS vendor (Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Adobe) is rapidly embedding generative AI features directly into their applications, moving AI from a specialized tool to a core productivity layer.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Competitive Landscape: The Hyperscalers\n\nThe market remains highly concentrated, though niche players are gaining ground in specific areas.\n\n| Provider | Key Strategic Focus (Early 2024) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** | Maintaining market leadership through breadth of services, deep enterprise penetration, and aggressive investment in proprietary AI chips (Trainium/Inferentia) to mitigate reliance on external silicon suppliers. |\n| **Microsoft Azure** | Leveraging its massive existing enterprise footprint (Windows Server, Office 365) via hybrid offerings (Azure Arc) and the deep strategic partnership with OpenAI to drive significant AI-centric growth. |\n| **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** | Focusing on data analytics, AI/ML superiority (Vertex AI), and open-source leadership (Kubernetes, Anthos) to appeal to innovation-focused and data-intensive enterprises. |\n| **Alibaba Cloud / Oracle Cloud** | **Alibaba** focuses heavily on the APAC region. **Oracle** maintains a strong niche in database workloads (OCI Autonomous Database) and specific enterprise applications. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Major Trends Shaping 2024 and Beyond\n\n### A. The Generative AI Revolution (GenAI)\nGenAI is not just a service; it’s the **new deployment paradigm**.\n\n* **Model Specialization:** Enterprises are moving beyond general models to fine-tune or deploy smaller, specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) tailored to proprietary enterprise data, often requiring hybrid or on-premises solutions for security.\n* **Inference Costs:** The primary financial hurdle in GenAI is the cost of running inference (generating outputs). Cloud providers are racing to build more efficient, custom hardware to lower these operational costs.\n\n### B. Distributed Cloud and Edge Computing\nThe need for low-latency processing is pushing compute capabilities closer to the user.\n\n* **Edge Maturity:** Edge computing is moving from pilot projects to production environments, driven by IoT, manufacturing automation, and retail.\n* **Hybrid/Multi-Cloud Reality:** True multi-cloud management (using multiple hyperscalers equally) remains complex. The current reality is more focused on **Hybrid Cloud** (mixing on-premise private cloud with one or two public clouds) managed via consistent control planes (e.g., AWS Outposts, Azure Arc).\n\n### C. Security, Governance, and Compliance (Sovereignty)\nSecurity overhead is growing exponentially with the complexity of distributed workloads.\n\n* **Security Posture Management:** Tools that automatically enforce policies across multi-cloud environments (Cloud Security Posture Management - CSPM) are becoming mandatory, not optional.\n* **Data Sovereignty:** Regulations like GDPR and local data laws are forcing complex architectural decisions, leading to increased usage of sovereign cloud regions and specialized offerings that guarantee data residency.\n\n### D. Sustainability in Cloud Operations\nEnvironmental impact is becoming a key purchasing criterion.\n\n* **Transparency:** Enterprises are demanding better reporting on the carbon footprint associated with their cloud usage.\n* **Efficiency Focus:** Cloud providers are optimizing data center cooling and energy sourcing, which indirectly translates into cost efficiency for the end-user.",

    "raw": "Write an article about the discovery of the earliest known evidence of human language.\n\n***\n\n## Whispers in the Stone: Unraveling the Earliest Evidence of Human Language\n\nThe human capacity for language—the complex, nuanced system that allows us to share thoughts, build societies, and create art—is arguably our defining characteristic. But when did this remarkable ability truly begin? For millennia, the origins of language were confined to theory and speculation, locked away in the mystery of prehistory.\n\nRecent archaeological, paleoanthropological, and genetic discoveries are finally allowing researchers to glimpse the dawn of spoken communication, pushing back the timeline for complex human interaction further than ever before. The search for the earliest evidence of language is not about finding a Rosetta Stone; it’s about piecing together subtle, indirect clues preserved in bone, tools, and ancient cave walls.\n\n### The Anatomy of Speech: Brains and Bones\n\nOne of the most compelling lines of evidence focuses on the physical requirements for speech. Human speech relies on a specific vocal tract structure—a lowered larynx—that allows for the wide range of sounds necessary for complex phonetics.\n\nFossil evidence, though sparse, has provided key insights. The discovery of the **hyoid bone** in archaic humans, particularly Neanderthals and early *Homo sapiens*, is crucial. The hyoid is the only bone in the body not directly articulated with another bone, serving as an anchor for the tongue and larynx.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the discovery of a Neanderthal hyoid bone at Kebara Cave in Israel suggested that Neanderthals possessed the necessary skeletal apparatus for modern-like vocalization. While some debate remains regarding the precise control and subtlety of their speech, the anatomy strongly suggests a capacity for complex sound production far beyond that of earlier hominins like *Australopithecus*.\n\nFurthermore, the increasing complexity observed in brain endocasts (molds of the inside of the skull) reveals the expansion of crucial language-related areas, such as **Broca’s area** (associated with speech production) and **Wernicke’s area** (associated with language comprehension), in early *Homo sapiens*.\n\n### The Cognitive Leap: Tools and Symbolism\n\nLanguage is more than just making sounds; it requires the cognitive ability to use arbitrary symbols (words) to represent complex ideas. This cognitive leap is reflected in material culture.\n\nThe shift from simple Oldowan tools to the more standardized and sophisticated **Mousterian stone tool industry** used by Neanderthals and early modern humans suggests planning, teaching, and abstract thought—all prerequisites for complex communication. Creating a prepared core, for instance, requires an understanding of geometry and sequence that implies sophisticated instruction.\n\nHowever, the most powerful evidence for symbolic thought—and thus, likely language—emerges with the **Upper Paleolithic Revolution**, dating back around 50,000 years. This era saw an explosion of cave art, figurative sculptures (like the famous Lion Man of Hohlenstein-Stadel), and personal ornamentation (beads and perforated shells).\n\nThese artifacts are not simply utilitarian; they are abstract representations. Creating a cave painting of a bison requires the mental ability to separate the idea of the bison from the actual animal, a process deeply intertwined with the symbolic nature of language.\n\n### Genomic Clues: The FOXP2 Gene\n\nPerhaps the most concrete evidence linking genetics to the potential origins of language comes from the **FOXP2 gene**. This gene is known to regulate the development of brain circuits required for fine motor control, particularly those involved in the rapid articulation of speech.\n\nModern humans share a specific variant of the FOXP2 gene. Crucially, this variant is present in Neanderthals and Denisovans. Genetic analysis suggests that the modern human version of FOXP2 became fixed in the *Homo sapiens* lineage sometime **before 300,000 years ago**.\n\nWhile having the gene does not automatically equate to full language capability—it is one component among many—its presence in our common ancestors with Neanderthals suggests that the *potential* for sophisticated vocal learning and speech syntax was present much earlier than the cultural explosion associated with modern *Homo sapiens*.\n\n### Reaching Back: *Homo erectus* and Communication\n\nIf we trace the line further back, to *Homo erectus*, the evidence becomes thinner but the necessity of some form of communication grows. *H. erectus* mastered fire, expanded across continents, and used Acheulean hand-axes for nearly two million years. Such widespread, long-term success required social cooperation and the transmission of knowledge across generations.\n\nDid *H. erectus* speak? Many linguists argue that while they likely possessed a rudimentary, perhaps protolanguage (more akin to simple noun-verb combinations), they probably lacked the grammatical complexity—syntax—that characterizes modern language. Their cognitive toolkit, as reflected in tool use, suggests communication adequate for survival, but perhaps not for poetry.\n\n### The Unwritten History\n\nThe discovery of the earliest language remains an elusive goal. Language leaves no direct fossils. Instead, researchers are piecing together a mosaic built from biological prerequisites (vocal tract, brain structure), cognitive milestones (symbolic art, complex tools), and genetic markers.\n\nWhat these varied lines of evidence suggest is that language likely did not spring into existence fully formed. Instead, it evolved gradually: from basic calls, to protolanguage in species like *Homo erectus*, to the sophisticated, syntactically rich language we use today, which may have solidified with the emergence of anatomically modern *Homo sapiens* between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago.\n\nThe whispers in the stone—the traces of early minds grappling with the world—continue to inform us that the capacity for complex thought, and the ability to share it, is an ancient, deeply woven thread in the tapestry of human evolution.",

Key Objectives of the European Union\n\nThe EU operates under several core goals outlined in its founding treaties:\n\n1.  **Promote Peace and Values:** Uphold democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and equality among its citizens.\n2.  **Establish a Single Market (Internal Market):** Ensure the free movement of **Goods, Services, Capital, and People** (the \"Four Freedoms\") without internal tariffs or barriers.\n3.  **Economic and Monetary Union (EMU):** Coordinate economic policies and manage the common currency (the Euro).\n4.  **Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP):** Speak with one voice on the world stage in diplomacy and defense.\n5.  **Cooperation on Justice and Home Affairs:** Work together on issues like immigration, asylum, and combating cross-border crime.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Institutions of the European Union\n\nThe EU's decision-making process involves several key institutions that balance the interests of the Member States, the citizens, and the Union as a whole.\n\n### A. The Legislators\n\n| Institution | Role | Composition/Representation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **European Parliament (EP)** | **Represents the citizens.** It co-decides on EU laws, approves the EU budget, and oversees other EU institutions. | Directly elected by EU citizens every five years (currently ~705 Members of the European Parliament, or MEPs). |\n| **Council of the European Union** (Council of Ministers) | **Represents the governments of the Member States.** It negotiates, adopts, and amends EU laws, usually jointly with the Parliament. | Composed of relevant government ministers from each Member State (e.g., Finance Ministers meet for economic issues). |\n\n### B. The Executive\n\n| Institution | Role | Composition/Representation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **European Commission** | **The executive arm and initiator of legislation.** It proposes new laws, implements decisions, upholds the EU treaties, and manages the EU budget. | 27 Commissioners (one from each Member State), headed by the President of the Commission. |\n\n### C. The Judiciary and Finance\n\n| Institution | Role | Significance |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)** | **Ensures that EU law is interpreted and applied uniformly** across all Member States. | Its rulings are supreme over national laws in areas where the EU has competence. |\n| **European Central Bank (ECB)** | **Manages the Euro** and sets monetary policy for the Eurozone countries. | Based in Frankfurt, Germany. |\n| **European Council** | **Sets the EU’s overall political direction and priorities.** (Note: This is distinct from the Council of the EU). | Composed of the Heads of State or Government of the 27 Member States, the President of the European Council, and the President of the Commission. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Major Policy Areas\n\nThe EU's influence spans nearly every aspect of life within the Union:\n\n*   **Single Market:** The free movement of goods means that a product legally sold in one EU country can generally be sold in all others without re-testing or tariffs.\n*   **Agriculture (CAP):** The Common Agricultural Policy provides subsidies and support to farmers across the bloc.\n*   **Trade Policy:** The EU negotiates trade agreements with third countries as a single bloc, giving it immense global bargaining power.\n*   **Digital Policy:** The EU is a global leader in digital regulation, notably with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and the **Digital Services Act (DSA)**.\n*   **Environmental Policy:** Sets ambitious climate targets (e.g., the European Green Deal) aimed at making the EU climate-neutral by 2050.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Criticisms and Challenges\n\nDespite its successes, the EU faces ongoing challenges:\n\n1.  **Democratic Deficit:** Critics argue that the most powerful body, the European Commission, is not directly elected, leading to concerns about accountability.\n2.  **Sovereignty Loss:** Member states often struggle with the degree of control they must cede to Brussels, particularly on sensitive issues like taxation or immigration.\n3.  **Bureaucracy (\"Red Tape\"):** The sheer volume of regulations can be seen as burdensome, especially for small businesses.\n4.  **Internal Division:** Differences in economic strength (e.g., North vs. South Europe) and political values (e.g., disagreements over the rule of law in certain Eastern member states) cause tension.",

    "raw": "The problem asks us to calculate the sum of scores based on a sequence of operations. The operations involve adding new scores, doubling the last score, summing the last two scores, or invalidating the last score. This type of problem, where we frequently need to access or modify the \"last\" element, is a classic use case for a **stack** data structure.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1.  **Data Structure**: We'll use a Python `list` to simulate a stack. This list will store only the *valid* scores. `append()` will act as push, `pop()` will remove the top, and `list[-1]` or `list[-2]` can access elements without removing them.\n\n2.  **Process Operations**: Iterate through each operation in the input string `s`. Since the operations are space-separated, we'll first split the string `s` into a list of individual operation tokens.\n\n3.  **Handle Each Operation Type**:\n    *   **Integer `x`**: If the token is a number, convert it to an integer and `append` it to our stack (record of scores).\n    *   **`+` (Plus)**: This operation means recording a new score that is the sum of the previous two valid scores.\n        *   Access the last two scores from the stack (`record[-1]` and `record[-2]`).\n        *   Calculate their sum.\n        *   `append` this sum to the stack.\n        *   *Constraint Check*: The problem statement guarantees that there will always be at least two previous valid scores for a `+` operation, so we don't need to worry about the stack having fewer than two elements.\n    *   **`D` (Double)**: This operation means recording a new score that is double the previous valid score.\n        *   Access the last score from the stack (`record[-1]`).\n        *   Double its value.\n        *   `append` this doubled value to the stack.\n        *   *Constraint Check*: The problem guarantees at least one previous valid score for a `D` operation.\n    *   **`C` (Cancel)**: This operation means invalidating the previous valid score.\n        *   `pop` the last score from the stack.\n        *   *Constraint Check*: The problem guarantees at least one previous valid score for a `C` operation.\n\n4.  **Final Summation**: After processing all operations, the stack (our `record` list) will contain all the valid scores. Calculate the sum of all elements in this list and return it.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (`s = \"5 2 C D +\"`)**\n\n1.  `record = []`\n2.  Split `s`: `operations = [\"5\", \"2\", \"C\", \"D\", \"+\"]`\n\n3.  **\"5\"**:\n    *   It's an integer. `record.append(5)`\n    *   `record = [5]`\n\n4.  **\"2\"**:\n    *   It's an integer. `record.append(2)`\n    *   `record = [5, 2]`\n\n5.  **\"C\"**:\n    *   It's a cancel operation. `record.pop()`\n    *   `record = [5]`\n\n6.  **\"D\"**:\n    *   It's a double operation. `record[-1]` is `5`. Double is `10`.\n    *   `record.append(10)`\n    *   `record = [5, 10]`\n\n7.  **\"+\"**:\n    *   It's a sum operation. `record[-1]` is `10`, `record[-2]` is `5`. Sum is `15`.\n    *   `record.append(15)`\n    *   `record = [5, 10, 15]`\n\n8.  End of operations.\n9.  Calculate `sum(record)`: `5 + 10 + 15 = 30`.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity**:\n    *   Splitting the input string `s` takes `O(L)` time, where `L` is the length of `s`.\n    *   We iterate through each operation once. There are at most `N` operations (where `N` is the number of space-separated tokens).\n    *   Each stack operation (`append`, `pop`, `list[-1]`, `list[-2]`) takes `O(1)` time.\n    *   The final `sum()` operation takes `O(K)` time, where `K` is the number of valid scores in the `record` list at the end. In the worst case, `K` can be up to `N`.\n    *   Therefore, the total time complexity is `O(L + N)`, which simplifies to `O(N)` if we consider `N` as the dominant factor for the number of operations.\n\n*   **Space Complexity**:\n    *   The `record` list can store up to `N` scores in the worst case (e.g., if all operations are adding new scores without cancellations).\n    *   The `operations` list created by `s.split()` also takes `O(N)` space.\n    *   Therefore, the total space complexity is `O(N)`.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calPoints(self, s: str) -> int:\n        record = []  # This list will act as our stack to store valid scores\n        \n        # Split the input string into individual operation tokens\n        operations = s.split()\n        \n        for op in operations:\n            if op == \"+\":\n                # Add the sum of the last two valid scores\n                # Problem guarantees there are always at least two scores for '+'\n                record.append(record[-1] + record[-2])\n            elif op == \"D\":\n                # Add double the last valid score\n                # Problem guarantees there is always at least one score for 'D'\n                record.append(record[-1] * 2)\n            elif op == \"C\":\n                # Invalidate (remove) the last valid score\n                # Problem guarantees there is always at least one score for 'C'\n                record.pop()\n            else:\n                # It's an integer, record it directly\n                record.append(int(op))\n                \n        # The sum of all valid scores in the record\n        return sum(record)\n\n```",

    "raw": "A person is walking toward a building. They have a briefcase in one hand and a smartphone in the other.\n\nHere are a few ways to interpret and elaborate on this scene:\n\n## Interpretation 1: The Business Professional Arriving\n\n**Focus:** Work, urgency, routine.\n\nThe sleek, glass-and-steel facade of the corporate tower looms ahead. The person, dressed in a sharp, dark suit that seems slightly rumpled from the journey, walks with a purposeful stride.\n\nIn their left hand, the **briefcase** (perhaps leather, slightly worn at the edges) contains the day's most critical documents or a high-powered laptop. Their right hand cradles a **smartphone**, its screen likely displaying an urgent email notification or the next meeting time. They are not looking at the phone but are acutely aware of its presence, perhaps pausing only to skim a final detail before they disappear inside, ready to tackle the day's demands.\n\n## Interpretation 2: The Modern Commuter Juggling Tasks\n\n**Focus:** Multitasking, connectivity, distraction.\n\nThis individual moves with the practiced rhythm of someone constantly connected. The **briefcase** might be less about formal documents and more about a gym kit, lunch, or personal essentials—a necessary vessel for modern life's baggage.\n\nTheir attention is clearly divided. The **smartphone** is actively in use; they might be reading an article, checking social media to decompress before work, or speaking quietly into the device while walking. The motion of walking is secondary to the information flow. The building represents the destination, but the journey itself is spent managing multiple streams of input.\n\n## Interpretation 3: The Salesperson or Consultant\n\n**Focus:** Preparation, presentation, high stakes.\n\nThe way they hold the **briefcase** suggests it's not just being carried, but presented—it signifies their role or service. They might be rehearsing key talking points mentally while glancing down at the **smartphone** to check the name or details of the person they are about to meet.\n\nTheir posture might be slightly stiffer, projecting confidence. The building is the venue for a high-stakes interaction. The briefcase holds the evidence or the contract; the phone holds the immediate logistical details or a final confirmation call to their assistant.\n\n---\n\n**To make the scene more vivid, consider adding:**\n\n* **Time of Day:** Is the morning sun glinting off the glass, or is it the shadowed twilight of an evening return?\n* **Weather:** Is the person shielding their face from a brisk wind, or are they enjoying a warm afternoon stroll?\n* **The Building's Nature:** Is it an imposing bank, a modern tech campus, or a university administrative building?",

    "raw": "Write a short, tense story about a—wait for it—**dinosaur** trapped in a modern suburban home.\n\n***\n\nThe silence in the suburban cul-de-sac was usually reserved for early Sunday mornings or the deep night. Today, it was the sound of utter disbelief, occasionally punctuated by the wet, rhythmic *thump-thump* from inside Number 42, the Henderson house.\n\nInside, the living room was unrecognizable. The IKEA coffee table was splintered kindling. The mounted 60-inch television had a large, jagged hole where the screen used to be, and through that hole, a wet, amber eye blinked slowly.\n\n*Tyrannosaurus Rex*. Not a hologram, not a dream. A full-grown, seven-ton, razor-toothed apex predator from the late Cretaceous period, currently standing belly-deep in the ruined remains of Mrs. Henderson’s prize-winning Persian rug.\n\nThe Rex, whom the neighborhood briefly and unofficially nicknamed ‘Rexy,’ was not enjoying the decor. Its massive head kept bumping the popcorn ceiling, showering gypsum dust onto its leathery hide. It was stressed, confused, and very, very hungry.\n\nMark Jenkins, the homeowner from next door, flattened himself behind the neighbor’s pristine white Prius, clutching a can of heavy-duty oven cleaner. It was pathetic, but it was all he had.\n\n\"Okay, okay, deep breaths, Mark,\" he whispered, sweat stinging his eyes. \"It’s just… an animal.\"\n\nThe house creaked, a mournful sound of stressed structural integrity. Rexy had tried to exit through the sliding glass patio door, mistaking the reflection for another rival, and had succeeded only in jamming the metal frame sideways.\n\nMark risked a peek. The Rex was moving with clumsy, terrifying grace toward the kitchen. It sniffed the air, its nostrils flaring. It didn't smell blood; it smelled processed cheese singles and stale microwave popcorn.\n\nThe oven cleaner felt heavy. What was the plan? Blind it? Annoy it into reversing through the portal it presumably arrived through?\n\nSuddenly, the dinosaur stopped. It lowered its head near the entryway to the kitchen island, its enormous jaws opening slightly, revealing teeth the size of steak knives. It wasn't roaring; it was investigating.\n\nMark realized what had captured the predator’s attention: the automatic cat feeder, blinking a cheerful green light, slowly dispensing a tiny pile of dry kibble onto its plastic tray.\n\nRexy nudged the machine with its snout. The plastic cracked. Another nudge, and the feeder shattered. A small cascade of brown pellets spilled onto the hardwood floor.\n\nThe T-Rex looked down at the meager offering. It let out a low, rumbling sound—not rage, but a profound, ancient disappointment.\n\nThe sound vibrated through Mark’s chest cavity. He knew he had seconds before that frustration turned into something violent. He had to move.\n\nHe scrambled out from behind the Prius, sprinting toward the front door of Number 42. He fumbled with the lock, his hands slick with panic sweat. He jammed the key in, turned it, and threw the door open, screaming the only thing that came to mind:\n\n“Hey! Look at me! Over here, Rexy!”\n\nThe dinosaur’s head whipped around, pivoting with alarming speed. The amber eye locked onto Mark.\n\nFor a long, agonizing moment, the suburban tension held. The air conditioner unit in the window whirred obliviously. Mark raised the oven cleaner can, ready to spray his only defense.\n\nThen, a sound cut through the standoff—a high-pitched, electronic chime.\n\nIt was the smart refrigerator, announcing a low water filter warning.\n\nThe distraction was enough. Rexy’s focus broke. It tilted its head, clearly analyzing the unfamiliar tone, and took a clumsy step backward—straight through the drywall separating the living room from the dining room.\n\nThe wall exploded inward in a shower of plaster and insulation. The Rex, momentarily disoriented by the sudden lack of solid support, stumbled and fell with a ground-shaking *CRUMP* directly into the space where the formal dining table had been.\n\nMark didn’t wait to see if it got up. He slammed the front door, locked every deadbolt, and sprinted back to the safety of his own lawn, dropping the useless can of cleaning spray.\n\nHe leaned against the Prius again, gasping, watching the ruined house. Silence returned, heavy and thick, broken only by the distant, muffled *thump... scrape... thump* of something enormous trying to right itself inside Number 42, now hopelessly trapped between the pantry and the staircase.\n\nMark looked down at his phone, which he’d somehow managed to keep hold of. He dialed 911.\n\n\"Yes, hello? I need to report an emergency at 42 Maple Drive,\" he choked out. \"It’s... it's a very large, unauthorized guest.\"\n\nHe paused, looking at the hole in the ceiling of the neighboring house.\n\n\"And I think,\" he added quietly, \"you’re going to need a bigger tranquilizer dart.\"",

Since $a \\geq 11$, $k$ can take values from 1 to 9.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $k=9$: $\\lfloor 100/a \\rfloor = 9$. This means $9 \\leq 100/a < 10$, so $10 < a \\leq 100/9 = 11.11\\dots$.

(1 term)\n    Contribution: $1 \\times 8 = 8$.\n    \n    \\item $k=7$: $\\lfloor 100/a \\rfloor = 7$. This means $7 \\leq 100/a < 8$, so $100/8 < a \\leq 100/7 \\approx 14.28$.

A common and efficient way to calculate Fibonacci numbers is using an iterative approach, which has `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity.\n\nHere's a Python function for this:\n\n```python\ndef fib_special(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the nth Fibonacci number for the given 'special' case.\n    This sequence follows the standard Fibonacci definition:\n    f(0) = 0\n    f(1) = 1\n    f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n > 1\n\n    Args:\n        n: The non-negative integer index for the Fibonacci number.\n\n    Returns:\n        The nth Fibonacci number.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If n is a negative integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input 'n' must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        # Initialize with f(0) and f(1)\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        # Iterate from the 2nd number up to the nth number\n        # Each iteration calculates the next Fibonacci number\n        for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return b\n\n# --- Test Cases ---\nprint(f\"fib_special(0) = {fib_special(0)}\")   # Expected: 0\nprint(f\"fib_special(1) = {fib_special(1)}\")   # Expected: 1\nprint(f\"fib_special(2) = {fib_special(2)}\")   # Expected: 1\nprint(f\"fib_special(3) = {fib_special(3)}\")   # Expected: 2\nprint(f\"fib_special(4) = {fib_special(4)}\")   # Expected: 3\nprint(f\"fib_special(5) = {fib_special(5)}\")   # Expected: 5\nprint(f\"fib_special(6) = {fib_special(6)}\")   # Expected: 8\nprint(f\"fib_special(10) = {fib_special(10)}\") # Expected: 55\nprint(f\"fib_special(20) = {fib_special(20)}\") # Expected: 6765\n\ntry:\n    print(f\"fib_special(-1) = {fib_special(-1)}\")\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(f\"Error for negative input: {e}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation of the \"Special\" (Iterative) Approach:**\n\n1.  **Base Cases:**\n    *   If `n` is 0, the function immediately returns 0.\n    *   If `n` is 1, the function immediately returns 1.\n    *   These handle the starting points of the sequence.\n\n2.  **Initialization:**\n    *   `a, b = 0, 1` sets up two variables to hold the two most recent Fibonacci numbers. Initially, `a` holds `F(0)` and `b` holds `F(1)`.\n\n3.  **Iteration:**\n    *   The `for _ in range(2, n + 1):` loop starts from index 2 (since `F(0)` and `F(1)` are already known) and goes up to `n`.\n    *   Inside the loop, `a, b = b, a + b` is the core of the calculation:\n        *   The new `a` becomes the old `b` (shifting the sequence forward).\n        *   The new `b` becomes the sum of the old `a` and old `b` (calculating the next Fibonacci number).\n    *   This effectively updates `a` to `F(i-1)` and `b` to `F(i)` in each step, until `b` holds `F(n)`.\n\n4.  **Return Value:**\n    *   After the loop completes, `b` will contain the `nth` Fibonacci number, which is then returned.\n\nThis iterative method is generally preferred over naive recursion for Fibonacci sequences because it avoids recalculating values multiple times, making it much more efficient for larger `n`.",

That is, the maximum value on the path to `(i-1,j)` OR the value of the current cell `grid[i][j]`, whichever is larger.\n2.  **If we come from `(i, j-1)`:** Similarly, the maximum value on this path to `(i,j)` would be `max(dp[i][j-1], grid[i][j])`.\n\nSince `dp[i][j]` represents the *minimum* of these possible maximums to reach `(i,j)`, we take the minimum of the two options:\n\n`dp[i][j] = min( max(dp[i-1][j], grid[i][j]), max(dp[i][j-1], grid[i][j]) )`\n\n**Handling Boundary Conditions:**\n\n*   **First Row (`i = 0, j > 0`):** We can only come from the left.\n    `dp[0][j] = max(dp[0][j-1], grid[0][j])`\n*   **First Column (`i > 0, j = 0`):** We can only come from above.\n    `dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], grid[i][0])`\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe result will be `dp[N-1][M-1]`.\n\n---\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\n`grid = [[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 8, 9]]`\n\nInitialize `dp` table of the same size, filled with a large value (infinity) initially.\n\n`dp` table (size 3x3):\n`dp[0][0] = grid[0][0] = 1`\n\n**Fill first row:**\n`dp[0][1] = max(dp[0][0], grid[0][1]) = max(1, 2) = 2`\n`dp[0][2] = max(dp[0][1], grid[0][2]) = max(2, 3) = 3`\n\n`dp` table:\n`[[1, 2, 3],`\n `[?, ?, ?],`\n `[?, ?, ?]]`\n\n**Fill first column:**\n`dp[1][0] = max(dp[0][0], grid[1][0]) = max(1, 6) = 6`\n`dp[2][0] = max(dp[1][0], grid[2][0]) = max(6, 7) = 7`\n\n`dp` table:\n`[[1, 2, 3],`\n `[6, ?, ?],`\n `[7, ?, ?]]`\n\n**Fill remaining cells:**\n\n`dp[1][1]` (from `(0,1)` or `(1,0)`):\n*   From `(0,1)`: `max(dp[0][1], grid[1][1]) = max(2, 5) = 5`\n*   From `(1,0)`: `max(dp[1][0], grid[1][1]) = max(6, 5) = 6`\n`dp[1][1] = min(5, 6) = 5`\n\n`dp[1][2]` (from `(0,2)` or `(1,1)`):\n*   From `(0,2)`: `max(dp[0][2], grid[1][2]) = max(3, 4) = 4`\n*   From `(1,1)`: `max(dp[1][1], grid[1][2]) = max(5, 4) = 5`\n`dp[1][2] = min(4, 5) = 4`\n\n`dp` table:\n`[[1, 2, 3],`\n `[6, 5, 4],`\n `[7, ?, ?]]`\n\n`dp[2][1]` (from `(1,1)` or `(2,0)`):\n*   From `(1,1)`: `max(dp[1][1], grid[2][1]) = max(5, 8) = 8`\n*   From `(2,0)`: `max(dp[2][0], grid[2][1]) = max(7, 8) = 8`\n`dp[2][1] = min(8, 8) = 8`\n\n`dp[2][2]` (from `(1,2)` or `(2,1)`):\n*   From `(1,2)`: `max(dp[1][2], grid[2][2]) = max(4, 9) = 9`\n*   From `(2,1)`: `max(dp[2][1], grid[2][2]) = max(8, 9) = 9`\n`dp[2][2] = min(9, 9) = 9`\n\nFinal `dp` table:\n`[[1, 2, 3],`\n `[6, 5, 4],`\n `[7, 8, 9]]`\n\nThe answer is `dp[2][2] = 9`.\n\n---\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * M) because we visit each cell in the grid exactly once to compute its `dp` value.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(N * M) to store the `dp` table.\n\n---\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef min_max_path_value(grid):\n    if not grid or not grid[0]:\n        return 0  # Or raise an error, depending on desired behavior for empty grid\n\n    N = len(grid)\n    M = len(grid[0])\n\n    # dp[i][j] stores the minimum possible value of the maximum element\n    # on any path from (0,0) to (i,j).\n    dp = [[0] * M for _ in range(N)]\n\n    # Base case\n    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n\n    # Fill first row (can only come from left)\n    for j in range(1, M):\n        dp[0][j] = max(dp[0][j-1], grid[0][j])\n\n    # Fill first column (can only come from above)\n    for i in range(1, N):\n        dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], grid[i][0])\n\n    # Fill the rest of the dp table\n    for i in range(1, N):\n        for j in range(1, M):\n            # Option 1: Come from above (i-1, j)\n            max_from_above = max(dp[i-1][j], grid[i][j])\n            \n            # Option 2: Come from left (i, j-1)\n            max_from_left = max(dp[i][j-1], grid[i][j])\n            \n            # dp[i][j] is the minimum of these two options\n            dp[i][j] = min(max_from_above, max_from_left)\n\n    return dp[N-1][M-1]\n\n# Test cases\ngrid1 = [[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 8, 9]]\nprint(f\"Grid 1: {grid1}, Minimax Path Value: {min_max_path_value(grid1)}\") # Expected: 9\n\ngrid2 = [[1, 10, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 10, 1]]\nprint(f\"Grid 2: {grid2}, Minimax Path Value: {min_max_path_value(grid2)}\") # Expected: 1\n\ngrid3 = [[10]]\nprint(f\"Grid 3: {grid3}, Minimax Path Value: {min_max_path_value(grid3)}\") # Expected: 10\n\ngrid4 = [[1, 5], [2, 3]]\nprint(f\"Grid 4: {grid4}, Minimax Path Value: {min_max_path_value(grid4)}\") # Expected: 3\n# Path 1->2->3 (max=3)\n# Path 1->5->3 (max=5)\n# Min(3,5) = 3\n```",

    "raw": "The **Lydian Dominant scale** is a fascinating and colorful scale that is widely used in jazz, fusion, and contemporary music for its bright, somewhat \"out-of-this-world\" sound.\n\nIt is often used over a **dominant seventh chord (V7)** when you want a sound that is both dominant and major, but with a distinctly Lydian flavor.\n\nHere is a complete breakdown of the Lydian Dominant scale.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Scale Formula and Intervals\n\nThe Lydian Dominant scale is essentially a **Mixolydian scale with a raised fourth degree ($\\sharp 4$)**. It is also known as the **Mixolydian $\\sharp 11$ scale**.\n\nThe formula for the Lydian Dominant scale is:\n\n$$\\text{Root} \\ (1) - \\text{Major Second} \\ (2) - \\text{Major Third} \\ (3) - \\text{Augmented Fourth} \\ (\\sharp 4 \\text{ or } \\flat 5) - \\text{Perfect Fifth} \\ (5) - \\text{Major Sixth} \\ (6) - \\text{Minor Seventh} \\ (b7)$$\n\n**Interval Pattern (in half steps):**\n$$\\text{Whole} - \\text{Whole} - \\text{Whole} - \\text{Half} - \\text{Whole} - \\text{Half} - \\text{Whole}$$\n\n**(2) - (2) - (2) - (1) - (2) - (1) - (2)**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Construction Example (C Lydian Dominant)\n\nIf we take the **C** note as the root:\n\n| Degree | Interval | Note Name |\n| :----: | :------: | :-------: |\n| 1      | Root     | **C**     |\n| 2      | Major 2nd| **D**     |\n| 3      | Major 3rd| **E**     |\n| $\\sharp 4$| Augmented 4th| **F$\\sharp$** |\n| 5      | Perfect 5th| **G**     |\n| 6      | Major 6th| **A**     |\n| $b7$   | Minor 7th| **B$\\flat$** |\n\n**The C Lydian Dominant Scale is: C - D - E - F$\\sharp$ - G - A - B$\\flat$**\n\n### Relationship to Other Scales\n\nThe Lydian Dominant scale is the **fourth mode of the Melodic Minor scale.**\n\n*   The **C Lydian Dominant** scale is the 4th mode of the **G Melodic Minor** scale.\n    *   G Melodic Minor: G - A - B$\\flat$ - C - D - E - F$\\sharp$ (When you start on the 4th note, C, you get C - D - E - F$\\sharp$ - G - A - B$\\flat$)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Sound and Application\n\n### The Key Characteristic\n\nThe defining sound of the Lydian Dominant scale comes from the **$\\sharp 4$ (or $\\sharp 11$) interval against the root and the minor seventh ($b7$)**.\n\n*   The **Major Third** gives it a bright, major quality (like a Major scale).\n*   The **Minor Seventh** gives it a dominant quality (like a Dominant 7th chord).\n*   The **$\\sharp 11$** adds the distinctive, exotic, and slightly tense color associated with the Lydian mode.\n\n### Harmonic Context (Chord Voicing)\n\nThis scale is almost exclusively used over a **Dominant Seventh chord with a sharp eleventh ($\\text{V7}\\sharp 11$)**.\n\nFor example, in the key of C Major, the V chord is G7. If you use the G Lydian Dominant scale, you are implying a **G7($\\sharp 11$)** chord (G - B - D - F - C$\\sharp$).\n\n**Common Usage:**\n\n1.  **V7 to I in Jazz:** It is the most common scale used for improvisation when playing the V7 chord that resolves to a Major I chord (e.g., G7 to Cmaj7).\n2.  **Tritone Substitution:** It is often used over the tritone substitution of the V chord (e.g., D$\\flat 7\\sharp 11$ resolving to Cmaj7).\n3.  **Modal Contexts:** Used heavily in fusion and instrumental rock music when the harmony is cycling through altered dominant chords.\n\n### Comparison with Related Scales\n\n| Scale Name | Intervals (from Root) | Key Characteristic |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Mixolydian** | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, $b7$ | The standard dominant scale (Implies $7 \\text{ or } 7sus$) |\n| **Lydian Dominant** | 1, 2, 3, $\\sharp 4$, 5, 6, $b7$ | Bright, exotic sound (Implies $7\\sharp 11$) |\n| **Altered Scale** | 1, $b2$, $\\sharp 2$, 3, $\\sharp 4$, $b5$, $b7$ | Highly tense, tense dominant sound (Implies $7alt$) |\n\nIn short, the Lydian Dominant scale provides the sound of a **Major chord quality (3rd)** combined with a **Dominant color ($b7$)**, spiced up with the **bright tension of the $\\sharp 11$**.",

    "raw": "The concept of a **\"black hole\"** has captivated scientists and the public alike for decades. It represents one of the most extreme and fascinating predictions of Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity.\n\nHere is a comprehensive overview of what a black hole is, how it forms, its key components, and why it is so significant.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is a Black Hole?\n\nIn the simplest terms, a **black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—not even light or other electromagnetic waves—can escape from it.**\n\nThis extreme gravitational pull is a result of a huge amount of mass being compressed into an incredibly small space.\n\n### The Origin of the Term\n\nThe concept of an object so massive that light cannot escape was first theorized in the 18th century, but the modern understanding solidified with the work of Karl Schwarzschild (who found the first exact solution to Einstein’s field equations) and later with the naming conventions established by physicist **John Archibald Wheeler** in the late 1960s.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Formation of Black Holes\n\nBlack holes are generally formed through the death of massive stars.\n\n### Stellar-Mass Black Holes (The Most Common)\n\n1.  **Massive Star Life:** A star maintains its structure through a delicate balance: the outward pressure generated by nuclear fusion in its core counteracts the inward pull of its own gravity.\n2.  **Fuel Depletion:** When a star significantly more massive than our Sun (generally $> 20$ times the Sun's mass) exhausts its nuclear fuel (usually hydrogen and helium), fusion stops.\n3.  **Gravitational Collapse:** Without the outward pressure from fusion, gravity wins, and the core collapses inward catastrophically.\n4.  **Supernova and Collapse:** This implosion often triggers a massive explosion known as a **Type II Supernova**. If the remaining core remnant has a mass greater than about three times the mass of the Sun (the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit), no known force can stop the collapse, and it shrinks indefinitely into a singularity, forming a black hole.\n\n### Other Types of Black Holes\n\n*   **Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs):** These giants reside at the centers of nearly all large galaxies (including our Milky Way, which harbors Sagittarius A*). They range from millions to billions of solar masses. Their formation mechanism is still an active area of research, possibly involving the merger of smaller black holes or the rapid accretion of gas in the early universe.\n*   **Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs):** These are between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes (hundreds to thousands of solar masses). Evidence for them is growing, possibly forming in dense star clusters.\n*   **Primordial Black Holes:** Hypothetical black holes formed immediately after the Big Bang, potentially having masses much smaller than a single star.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Anatomy of a Black Hole\n\nA non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole is defined by three key features:\n\n### A. The Singularity (The Center)\nThis is the core of the black hole. It is a point of **infinite density and zero volume** where all the original mass of the star is crushed. Our current laws of physics break down at the singularity.\n\n### B. The Event Horizon (The Point of No Return)\nThis is the boundary surrounding the singularity. It is not a physical surface but rather a mathematical boundary in spacetime.\n*   **Crucially:** If anything crosses the event horizon, it requires a speed faster than the speed of light to escape the gravitational pull—which is impossible.\n*   The **radius of the event horizon** is known as the **Schwarzschild Radius**.\n\n### C. The Accretion Disk (The Light Source)\nThough the black hole itself is invisible, matter falling into it forms a spectacular feature. As gas, dust, and stellar debris spiral inward, they are compressed, heated by friction to millions of degrees, and emit intense radiation—primarily X-rays and gamma rays—making the area *around* the black hole the brightest objects in the universe (quasars).\n\n### D. Relativistic Jets (For Spinning Black Holes)\nMany black holes, especially those actively feeding, launch enormous beams of plasma and energy perpendicularly from the poles, traveling close to the speed of light. These jets are thought to be powered by the black hole's intense magnetic fields twisted by its rapid rotation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How Do We Know They Exist If They Are Black?\n\nSince black holes emit no light, we cannot observe them directly. Instead, scientists detect them through their powerful **gravitational influence** on nearby matter and spacetime:\n\n1.  **Gravitational Effects:** Observing stars orbiting a seemingly empty point in space. The mass of the unseen object can be calculated based on the speed and radius of the star's orbit (e.g., confirming Sagittarius A*).\n2.  **X-ray Emissions:** Detecting the intense X-rays emitted by the superheated gas in the accretion disk surrounding the black hole.\n3.  **Gravitational Lensing:** Observing how the black hole's gravity warps and magnifies the light coming from objects behind it.\n4.  **Gravitational Waves:** The LIGO and Virgo collaborations detect ripples in spacetime caused by catastrophic events involving black holes, such as the merger of two black holes or a black hole colliding with a neutron star.\n5.  **Direct Imaging (The EHT):** In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration released the first-ever image of a black hole (M87*), revealing the silhouette of the event horizon against the glowing backdrop of the surrounding accretion disk.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Key Concepts in Black Hole Physics\n\n### Spaghettification (Tidal Forces)\nIf an object falls feet-first toward a stellar-mass black hole, the gravitational pull on the feet (closer to the singularity) will be vastly stronger than the pull on the head. This difference in force stretches the object vertically and squeezes it horizontally until it is ripped apart into a long, thin strand—a process vividly nicknamed **spaghettification**.\n\n### Hawking Radiation\nTheoretical physicist Stephen Hawking proposed that quantum effects near the event horizon cause black holes to slowly emit thermal radiation, known as **Hawking Radiation**. This implies that black holes are not entirely \"black\" and, given enough time (trillions upon trillions of years), they will eventually evaporate entirely.",

    "raw": "To parse a command string like `\"mv a b\"` into its command and a list of arguments, you can use Python's `split()` method. For more robust parsing, especially if arguments might contain spaces and be quoted, the `shlex` module is a better choice.\n\nLet's look at both methods:\n\n### 1. Using `str.split()` (Simple Cases)\n\nThis method is straightforward and works well for commands where arguments are separated by single or multiple spaces and don't contain spaces themselves (unless they are escaped, which `split()` won't handle directly).\n\n```python\ncommand_string = \"mv a b\"\n\n# Split the string by whitespace. By default, split() handles\n# multiple spaces and strips leading/trailing whitespace.\nparts = command_string.split()\n\nif parts:\n    command = parts[0]      # The first element is the command\n    arguments = parts[1:]   # The rest are the arguments\nelse:\n    command = \"\"\n    arguments = []\n\nprint(f\"Original string: '{command_string}'\")\nprint(f\"Command: '{command}'\")\nprint(f\"Arguments: {arguments}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Another example (ls with one arg) ---\")\ncommand_string_ls = \"ls -l\"\nparts_ls = command_string_ls.split()\ncommand_ls = parts_ls[0]\narguments_ls = parts_ls[1:]\nprint(f\"Original string: '{command_string_ls}'\")\nprint(f\"Command: '{command_ls}'\")\nprint(f\"Arguments: {arguments_ls}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Another example (no args) ---\")\ncommand_string_no_args = \"pwd\"\nparts_no_args = command_string_no_args.split()\ncommand_no_args = parts_no_args[0] if parts_no_args else \"\"\narguments_no_args = parts_no_args[1:] if parts_no_args else []\nprint(f\"Original string: '{command_string_no_args}'\")\nprint(f\"Command: '{command_no_args}'\")\nprint(f\"Arguments: {arguments_no_args}\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nOriginal string: 'mv a b'\nCommand: 'mv'\nArguments: ['a', 'b']\n\n--- Another example (ls with one arg) ---\nOriginal string: 'ls -l'\nCommand: 'ls'\nArguments: ['-l']\n\n--- Another example (no args) ---\nOriginal string: 'pwd'\nCommand: 'pwd'\nArguments: []\n```\n\n### 2. Using `shlex.split()` (Robust Parsing)\n\nThe `shlex` module is designed for parsing shell-like syntax. It correctly handles quoted strings (single or double quotes), escaped characters, and comments. This is the recommended approach for more complex or real-world scenarios.\n\n```python\nimport shlex\n\ncommand_string = \"mv a b\"\n\n# shlex.split() will parse the string like a Unix shell\nparts = shlex.split(command_string)\n\nif parts:\n    command = parts[0]\n    arguments = parts[1:]\nelse:\n    command = \"\"\n    arguments = []\n\nprint(f\"Original string: '{command_string}'\")\nprint(f\"Command: '{command}'\")\nprint(f\"Arguments: {arguments}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Example with quoted arguments ---\")\ncommand_string_quoted = \"cp 'my document with spaces.txt' \\\"another file.pdf\\\"\"\nparts_quoted = shlex.split(command_string_quoted)\ncommand_quoted = parts_quoted[0]\narguments_quoted = parts_quoted[1:]\nprint(f\"Original string: '{command_string_quoted}'\")\nprint(f\"Command: '{command_quoted}'\")\nprint(f\"Arguments: {arguments_quoted}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Example with escaped spaces ---\")\ncommand_string_escaped = \"rm my\\\\ file.txt\"\nparts_escaped = shlex.split(command_string_escaped)\ncommand_escaped = parts_escaped[0]\narguments_escaped = parts_escaped[1:]\nprint(f\"Original string: '{command_string_escaped}'\")\nprint(f\"Command: '{command_escaped}'\")\nprint(f\"Arguments: {arguments_escaped}\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nOriginal string: 'mv a b'\nCommand: 'mv'\nArguments: ['a', 'b']\n\n--- Example with quoted arguments ---\nOriginal string: 'cp 'my document with spaces.txt' \"another file.pdf\"'\nCommand: 'cp'\nArguments: ['my document with spaces.txt', 'another file.pdf']\n\n--- Example with escaped spaces ---\nOriginal string: 'rm my\\ file.txt'\nCommand: 'rm'\nArguments: ['my file.txt']\n```\n\n### Which to choose?\n\n*   **`str.split()`:** Use this if you are absolutely sure that your arguments will *never* contain spaces, or if you control the input and it's always simple whitespace-separated values. It's simpler and slightly faster for these specific cases.\n*   **`shlex.split()`:** Use this for almost all real-world scenarios, especially when dealing with user input or parsing actual shell commands, as it provides robust handling for quotes, escapes, and other shell conventions.",

    "raw": "A $1000$ $\\text{m}$ cable is being used to connect two points $A$ and $B$ in a room. The cable is suspended between two poles of equal height at points $A$ and $B$. The distance between the poles is $1000$ $\\text{m}$. The cable is modeled by the curve $y=a \\cosh \\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)$. The lowest point of the cable is at $(0, a)$. The cable touches the ground at its lowest point. The cable is connected to the poles at the points $A$ and $B$. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(-500, y_A)$ and $(500, y_B)$. The length of the cable is $1000$ $\\text{m}$. The cable is symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis. The lowest point of the cable is at $(0, a)$, and the cable touches the ground at this point, so $y(0) = a$. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(-500, y_A)$ and $(500, y_B)$. The distance between the poles is $1000$ $\\text{m}$. The cable is connected to the poles at the points $A$ and $B$. The height of the poles is $y_A = y_B$. Let $L$ be the length of the cable. We are given $L=1000$ $\\text{m}$.\n\nThe length of a curve $y=f(x)$ from $x=x_1$ to $x=x_2$ is given by the integral:\n$$L = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2} dx$$\nFor the catenary curve $y = a \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)$, the derivative is:\n$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(a \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)\\right) = a \\cdot \\frac{1}{a} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) = \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)$$\nThen,\n$$1 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 = 1 + \\sinh^2\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) = \\cosh^2\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)$$\nSo, the integrand is:\n$$\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\cosh^2\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)} = \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)$$\nThe length of the cable between $x=-500$ and $x=500$ is:\n$$L = \\int_{-500}^{500} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) dx$$\nSince $\\cosh$ is an even function,\n$$L = 2 \\int_{0}^{500} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) dx$$\nThe integral of $\\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)$ is $a \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)$.\n$$L = 2 \\left[ a \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) \\right]_0^{500} = 2 \\left( a \\sinh\\left(\\frac{500}{a}\\right) - a \\sinh(0) \\right)$$\nSince $\\sinh(0) = 0$, we have:\n$$L = 2a \\sinh\\left(\\frac{500}{a}\\right)$$\nWe are given that the length of the cable is $L=1000$ $\\text{m}$.\n$$1000 = 2a \\sinh\\left(\\frac{500}{a}\\right)$$\nDividing by 2, we get:\n$$500 = a \\sinh\\left(\\frac{500}{a}\\right)$$\nLet $u = \\frac{500}{a}$. Then $a = \\frac{500}{u}$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$500 = \\frac{500}{u} \\sinh(u)$$\nDividing by 500 (since $500 \\neq 0$):\n$$1 = \\frac{1}{u} \\sinh(u)$$\n$$u = \\sinh(u)$$\nWe are looking for the solution $u$ to the equation $u = \\sinh(u)$.\nWe know that $\\sinh(u) = \\frac{e^u - e^{-u}}{2}$. So, the equation is:\n$$u = \\frac{e^u - e^{-u}}{2}$$\n$$2u = e^u - e^{-u}$$\nWe know that for $u > 0$, $\\sinh(u) > u$. For $u < 0$, $\\sinh(u) < u$.\nIf $u=0$, then $\\sinh(0) = 0$, so $u=0$ is a solution.\nIf $u=0$, then $\\frac{500}{a} = 0$, which means $a$ would have to be infinite, which is not possible for a hanging cable of finite length.\nSince the cable is suspended, we must have $y_A > a$, which means $\\cosh\\left(\\frac{500}{a}\\right) > 1$, which implies $\\frac{500}{a} \\neq 0$. Thus $u \\neq 0$.\n\nLet's re-read the problem carefully.\nThe distance between the poles is $1000$ $\\text{m}$. The poles are at $x=-500$ and $x=500$.\nThe length of the cable is $1000$ $\\text{m}$.\nThe cable is modeled by $y = a \\cosh(\\frac{x}{a})$.\nThe lowest point is at $(0, a)$, so $y(0)=a$. This is consistent with the equation.\nThe cable touches the ground at its lowest point, so $y(0)=0$.\nIf the cable touches the ground at its lowest point, then $a=0$.\nIf $a=0$, the model $y=a \\cosh(\\frac{x}{a})$ is not defined in the standard sense as a catenary.\n\nIf the cable touches the ground at its lowest point, then $y(0)=0$.\nSince $y(0) = a \\cosh(0) = a \\cdot 1 = a$, we must have $a=0$.\nIf $a=0$, then the length equation $L = 2a \\sinh\\left(\\frac{500}{a}\\right)$ leads to an indeterminate form $\\lim_{a\\to 0^+} 2a \\sinh\\left(\\frac{500}{a}\\right)$.\nLet $u = 500/a$. As $a \\to 0^+$, $u \\to \\infty$.\n$$L = 2 \\frac{500}{u} \\sinh(u) = 1000 \\frac{e^u - e^{-u}}{2u} = 500 \\frac{e^u - e^{-u}}{u}$$\nAs $u \\to \\infty$, $e^{-u} \\to 0$, so $L \\approx 500 \\frac{e^u}{u}$. This limit is $\\infty$, not $1000$.\nSo, the condition \"The cable touches the ground at its lowest point\" contradicts the other given conditions (distance $1000$ $\\text{m}$, length $1000$ $\\text{m}$).\n\nLet's assume the problem meant that the lowest point of the cable is at a height $a$ above the ground, and the problem statement is slightly imprecise, or the lowest point is not at the origin $y=0$.\n\nCase 1: The lowest point of the cable is $(0, a)$ and the ground is the line $y=0$. This is what we used, and it led to $u = \\sinh(u)$ where $u = 500/a$. The only solution is $u=0$, which is not physically meaningful here.\n\nLet's re-examine the setup. A cable of length $L=1000$ $\\text{m}$ connects two points $A$ and $B$ separated by a horizontal distance $D=1000$ $\\text{m}$.\nIf $L=D$, the cable must be perfectly straight, i.e., a straight line.\nIf the cable is a straight line, $y = mx + c$.\nThe points are $(-500, y_A)$ and $(500, y_B)$. Since the height is equal, $y_A = y_B$.\nThe slope $m = \\frac{y_B - y_A}{500 - (-500)} = 0$. So $y=c$ (a horizontal line).\nThe length of a horizontal line segment from $x=-500$ to $x=500$ is $\\sqrt{(500 - (-500))^2 + (c-c)^2} = \\sqrt{1000^2} = 1000$ $\\text{m}$. This is consistent with $L=1000$ $\\text{m}$.\n\nIf the cable is a straight line $y=c$, the catenary model $y = a \\cosh(\\frac{x}{a})$ must approximate this straight line.\nFor $y = a \\cosh(\\frac{x}{a})$ to be a straight line $y=c$, we need the parameter $a$ to be very large.\nIf $a \\to \\infty$, we use the Taylor expansion for $\\cosh(z) = 1 + \\frac{z^2}{2!} + \\frac{z^4}{4!} + \\dots$\n$$y = a \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{24} \\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)^4 + \\dots \\right) = a + \\frac{x^2}{2a} + \\frac{x^4}{24a^3} + \\dots$$\nIf $a \\to \\infty$, then $y \\to a$. Since the lowest point is $(0, a)$, this implies $y \\to \\infty$, which is not a horizontal line $y=c$.\n\nLet's go back to the equation $u = \\sinh(u)$ for $u=500/a$.\nSince the problem states the cable is modeled by the catenary, and we found $L=D$ implies $u=\\sinh(u)$, which only has the trivial solution $u=0$, this strongly suggests that the physical situation described is that of a straight cable, which is the limiting case of a catenary with a very large parameter $a$.\n\nIf $a$ is very large, $u = 500/a$ is very small.\nFor small $u$, we use the approximation $\\sinh(u) \\approx u + \\frac{u^3}{6}$.\nThe equation $u = \\sinh(u)$ becomes:\n$$u \\approx u + \\frac{u^3}{6}$$\n$$\\frac{u^3}{6} \\approx 0$$\nThis confirms that the only non-trivial scenario that *almost* fits the catenary model in this extreme case is $u \\approx 0$.\n\nIf $u \\to 0$, then $a = 500/u \\to \\infty$.\nIf $a$ is infinite, the height of the connection points is:\n$$y_A = a \\cosh\\left(\\frac{500}{a}\\right) = a \\cosh(u) \\approx a \\left(1 + \\frac{u^2}{2}\\right) = a + \\frac{a u^2}{2}$$\nSubstituting $u=500/a$:\n$$y_A \\approx a + \\frac{a}{2} \\left(\\frac{500}{a}\\right)^2 = a + \\frac{500^2}{2a}$$\nSince $L=1000$ and $D=1000$, the cable is straight and horizontal. A horizontal cable has zero sag, meaning $y_A = y_{\\text{lowest point}}$.\nIf the cable is horizontal, the sag $S$ is zero. The sag is defined as $S = y_A - y(0)$.\nFor the catenary:\n$$S = y_A - a = a \\cosh\\left(\\frac{500}{a}\\right) - a = a \\left( \\cosh\\left(\\frac{500}{a}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nUsing the approximation $\\cosh(u) - 1 \\approx \\frac{u^2}{2}$:\n$$S \\approx a \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{500}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{500^2}{2a}$$\nIf the cable is straight and horizontal, the sag $S=0$.\n$$0 = \\frac{500^2}{2a}$$\nThis implies $a \\to \\infty$, which corresponds to $u \\to 0$.\n\nLet's check the initial constraint: \"The cable touches the ground at its lowest point.\" This means $y(0)=0$.\nSince $y(0)=a$, this means $a=0$. As shown before, $a=0$ is inconsistent with $L=1000$ and $D=1000$.\n\nGiven the conflict between the geometric constraints ($L=D=1000$) and the standard catenary model (which requires $L>D$ unless $a\\to\\infty$), the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem describes a straight cable, which is the limiting case of the catenary when $a$ is very large.\n\nIf the cable is straight and horizontal, the height of the connection points $y_A$ is constant.\nThe lowest point is $(0, y(0))$. If the cable touches the ground at the lowest point, then $y(0)=0$.\nSince the cable is horizontal, $y(x) = 0$ for all $x$ between $-500$ and $500$.\nThen $y_A = 0$.\nThe coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(-500, 0)$ and $(500, 0)$.\nThe model $y = a \\cosh(x/a)$ should then represent $y=0$.\nIf $y=0$, then $a \\cosh(x/a) = 0$. Since $\\cosh(x/a) > 0$, this implies $a=0$, which is the undefined limit case.\n\nIf we ignore the statement \"The cable touches the ground at its lowest point\" and only use the consistent information: $L=D=1000$. This implies the cable is straight and horizontal.\nIf the cable is horizontal, $y_A = y_B = c$.\nIf we are forced to use the catenary model, we must conclude $a \\to \\infty$.\nIf $a \\to \\infty$, the height $y_A = a \\cosh(500/a) \\to \\infty$. This contradicts the cable being at ground level ($y=0$).\n\nLet's assume the ground is defined by the lowest point of the cable, $y(0)=a$. If the lowest point touches the ground, the ground level is $y=a$. If $y=a$, then $y(0)=a$, which is satisfied. But this means the ground is elevated relative to some absolute zero.\n\nIf the statement means the lowest point is at $y=0$ (absolute ground level), then $a=0$, leading to $L \\to \\infty$, contradiction.\n\nThe only possibility that reconciles the length $L=1000$ and separation $D=1000$ is that the cable is straight and horizontal.\n$$y(x) = y_A = c$$\nIf the cable is straight, the catenary model $y = a \\cosh(x/a)$ cannot perfectly describe it unless $a \\to \\infty$.\n\nIf we assume the problem implies the horizontal case ($a \\to \\infty$):\nThe height $y_A$ is the height of the poles. The problem doesn't ask for $y_A$. It asks for the value of $a$ or possibly the height $y_A$ if we discard the $L=D$ implication.\n\nIf we discard $L=D$ and assume the initial premise: $y(0)=a$ and $y(0)=0$ (touches ground), then $a=0$, which contradicts $L=1000$.\n\nThe scenario $L=D$ is a very specific one, $1000$ $\\text{m}$ cable spanning $1000$ $\\text{m}$. This strongly suggests a horizontal line.\n\nIf the cable is horizontal, $y(x) = y_A$.\nThe lowest point is $(0, y_A)$.\nIf this lowest point touches the ground, $y_A = 0$.\nThe coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(-500, 0)$ and $(500, 0)$.\n\nThe question seems ill-posed because $L=D$ forces the curve to be a straight line, which is not a catenary unless $a \\to \\infty$. If $a \\to \\infty$, then $y_A = a + 500^2/(2a) \\to \\infty$, which contradicts $y_A=0$ (ground level).\n\nAssuming the intent was to ask for the height $y_A$ under the condition $L=1000$ and $D=1000$:\nThe only configuration is a horizontal cable $y=c$. If it touches the ground at the lowest point, $c=0$.\nHeight of the poles is $y_A = 0$.\n\nIf we are forced to find a non-zero $a$ such that $L=1000$ and $D=1000$, there is no solution as $u = \\sinh(u)$ only has $u=0$.\n\nWe must conclude that the physical setup $L=D$ implies the result must be interpreted as the limit case of the catenary where the sag is zero, $S=0$, leading to $a \\to \\infty$ and $y_A \\to \\infty$ unless the ground level is elevated.\n\nGiven the constraint \"The cable touches the ground at its lowest point,\" we interpret this as $y(0) = 0$.\nFrom the catenary model, $y(0) = a$. Thus $a=0$.\nIf $a=0$, $L = 2a \\sinh(500/a)$.\nUsing L'Hopital's rule on $f(a) = 2a \\sinh(500/a)$ as $a \\to 0^+$. Let $u=500/a$, $a=500/u$.\n$L = 1000 \\frac{\\sinh u}{u}$. As $u \\to \\infty$, $L \\to \\infty$. This contradicts $L=1000$.\n\nConclusion: The problem statement contains contradictory information. The only consistent interpretation of the spatial configuration ($L=D=1000$ m) is that the cable is straight and horizontal, meaning the height of the poles $y_A$ is the same as the lowest point, and the sag is zero. If the lowest point touches the ground ($y_{min}=0$), then $y_A=0$.\n\nIf the question implies that the height of the poles $y_A$ must be determined using the catenary equation, then $L$ must be greater than $D$. Since $L=D$, the only way to resolve this with the catenary model is to admit the degenerate case $a \\to \\infty$, which leads to a horizontal cable. In this case, the height $y_A$ is undetermined by the cable length formula, but determined by the ground constraint.\n\nSince the lowest point touches the ground $y_{min}=0$, and for the catenary $y_{min}=a$, we must have $a=0$. This leads to $L \\to \\infty$. The length $L=1000$ must be the definitive constraint.\n\nIf $L=1000$ and $D=1000$, the cable is horizontal, $y(x) = y_A$.\nIf the lowest point touches the ground, $y_A = 0$.\nThe height of the poles is $y_A=0$ $\\text{m}$.\n\nIf the problem intended to use the catenary model with a non-zero sag, $L$ must be greater than $1000$ $\\text{m}$. Let's assume there was a typo and $L=1001$ $\\text{m}$ instead, just to see how $a$ would be found.\n$1001 = 2a \\sinh(500/a)$.\n$500.5 = a \\sinh(500/a)$.\nIf $u=500/a$, $u = 500.5 \\frac{\\sinh u}{500} = 1.001 \\sinh u$.\n$u = 1.001 \\sinh u$. Since $1.001 > 1$, there is a non-zero solution for $u$.\nNumerically, $u \\approx 18.74$.\nThen $a = 500/u \\approx 26.68$ $\\text{m}$.\nThe height of the poles would be $y_A = a \\cosh(u) \\approx 26.68 \\cosh(18.74) \\approx 5127.5$ $\\text{m}$.\nThe lowest point would be $a \\approx 26.68$ $\\text{m}$ above ground (if $y(0)=a$).\n\nHowever, based on the exact numbers given: $L=1000$ $\\text{m}$ and $D=1000$ $\\text{m}$.\nThe cable is straight and horizontal, $y(x) = c$.\nLowest point touches ground: $c=0$.\nThe height of the poles $y_A = c = 0$ $\\text{m}$.\nThe parameter $a$ in the catenary model is infinite, indicating a straight line.\n\nThe question does not ask for $a$, but the premise implies the physical setup must be satisfied. The physical setup dictates $y_A=0$.\n\nFinal answer based on the inescapable physical consequence of $L=D$:\nThe height of the poles $y_A$ is $0$ $\\text{m}$.",

    "raw": "Identify the five most common cognitive biases affecting decision-making in a business context.\n\nHere are five of the most common cognitive biases that significantly impact decision-making in a business context:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Confirmation Bias\n\n**Description:** The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's prior beliefs or values. Decision-makers selectively seek out data that validates their initial hypothesis while ignoring or downplaying contradictory evidence.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n*   **Poor Strategic Choices:** Executives may cling to a failing strategy because they only listen to reports that suggest it’s about to turn around.\n*   **Hiring Mistakes:** Interviewers focus only on questions that confirm their initial positive or negative impression of a candidate, rather than objectively assessing all skills.\n*   **Market Research Flaws:** Teams structure surveys or focus groups to elicit the desired customer feedback, leading to flawed product development.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Availability Heuristic (Availability Bias)\n\n**Description:** A mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method, or decision. Vivid, recent, or emotionally charged events are judged as more likely or frequent than they statistically are.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n*   **Risk Mismanagement:** A company might overinvest in securing against a recent, highly publicized security breach (even if statistically rare) while neglecting more common, but less dramatic, operational risks.\n*   **Product Development:** Management might rush to copy a competitor's recent, highly successful new feature, assuming that feature is the primary driver of success, rather than understanding the underlying market dynamics.\n*   **Overconfidence:** A recent string of successful deals makes managers overestimate their future success rate, leading to overly aggressive sales targets.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Anchoring Bias\n\n**Description:** The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the \"anchor\") when making decisions, even if that information is irrelevant. Subsequent judgments are made by adjusting away from the anchor, but rarely far enough.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n*   **Negotiations:** The initial price mentioned by either a buyer or seller sets the range for the entire negotiation, often leading to suboptimal outcomes if the anchor was extreme.\n*   **Budgeting and Forecasting:** The previous year's budget often serves as the anchor for the current year's budget. If the previous budget was inefficiently high, the new budget will likely remain high, regardless of current needs.\n*   **Valuation:** In mergers and acquisitions, the seller’s initial asking price heavily influences the buyer’s final offer, even if the true intrinsic value is much lower.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Sunk Cost Fallacy\n\n**Description:** The tendency to continue investing resources (time, money, effort) into a failing endeavor because of the resources already invested, rather than cutting losses and moving to a better opportunity. The decision is based on past, irrecoverable costs rather than future potential.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n*   **Project Continuation:** A business continues to fund an outdated IT system or a product line that clearly isn't gaining market traction simply because millions have already been spent developing it.\n*   **Hiring and Training:** Managers refuse to fire an underperforming senior employee because the company invested significant money and time training them, hoping they will eventually improve.\n*   **Long-Term Strategy:** Organizations avoid pivoting to a new, necessary technology because they have too much invested in the legacy system.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Overconfidence Bias\n\n**Description:** The tendency for a person's subjective confidence in their judgments to be reliably greater than their objective accuracy. In business, this often manifests as overestimating one's own abilities, knowledge, or the precision of a forecast.\n\n**Business Impact:**\n*   **Project Deadlines:** Managers consistently underestimate the time and resources required for complex projects, leading to missed deadlines and budget overruns.\n*   **Market Entry:** Entrepreneurs or leaders may launch products assuming guaranteed success based on their own skill, failing to adequately prepare for competitive response or market resistance.\n*   **Financial Projections:** Sales teams provide highly optimistic revenue forecasts because they are overly confident in their closing ability, leading to poor resource allocation based on inflated expectations.",

    "raw": "List of historical figures who are generally considered to be innovators in the field of computing.\n\nHere is a list of historical figures generally considered to be innovators in the field of computing, spanning from early theoretical work to the development of modern electronic computers:\n\n---\n\n## Early Theoretical & Mechanical Foundations (Pre-20th Century)\n\nThese figures laid the groundwork for computation, logic, and the concept of programmable machines.\n\n1.  **Charles Babbage (1791–1871):** Often called the \"Father of the Computer.\" He conceived of the **Difference Engine** (an automatic mechanical calculator) and, more importantly, the **Analytical Engine**, which was the first design for a general-purpose, programmable mechanical computer.\n2.  **Ada Lovelace (1815–1852):** A mathematician who worked with Babbage. She recognized that the Analytical Engine could do more than just calculation and wrote what is considered the **first algorithm** intended to be carried out by a machine. She is regarded as the first computer programmer.\n3.  **George Boole (1815–1864):** Developed **Boolean Algebra**, a system of logic that uses only two values (true/false, 1/0). This mathematical foundation is essential to all modern digital circuit design and computer logic.\n4.  **Herman Hollerith (1860–1929):** Invented the **punch card tabulating machine** to process data from the 1890 U.S. Census. His company eventually became part of International Business Machines (IBM).\n5.  **Vannevar Bush (1890–1974):** Designed the **Differential Analyzer** (a large-scale analog computer) in the 1930s. He also proposed the **Memex**, a conceptual electro-mechanical device for storing and linking information, which was highly influential on hypertext and the early internet.\n\n---\n\n## The Dawn of Modern Computing (1930s–1940s)\n\nThis era saw the transition from mechanical to electrical and electromechanical devices, leading directly to the first electronic computers.\n\n6.  **Alan Turing (1912–1954):** A pivotal figure in theoretical computer science. He formalized the concepts of **algorithms and computation** with the theoretical **Turing Machine**. During WWII, he was instrumental in breaking the Enigma code using early electromechanical computation devices (the Bombe).\n7.  **Konrad Zuse (1910–1995):** A German engineer who built the **Z3 (1941)**, generally considered the world's first functional, programmable, fully automatic digital computer. He also developed the Plankalkül, one of the first high-level programming languages.\n8.  **John Atanasoff (1903–1995) & Clifford Berry (1918–1963):** Built the **Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC)** (completed c. 1942), often cited as the first electronic digital computing device. It used vacuum tubes for calculation but was not programmable in the modern sense.\n9.  **John Mauchly (1907–1980) & J. Presper Eckert (1919–1995):** Key figures in the development of the **ENIAC** (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) at the University of Pennsylvania. ENIAC (1945) was the first large-scale, general-purpose, electronic digital computer. They later developed **UNIVAC I**, the first commercial computer in the U.S.\n10. **John von Neumann (1903–1957):** A brilliant mathematician who formalized the concept of the **stored-program architecture** (the **Von Neumann architecture**), where program instructions and data are held in the same memory space. This design is the basis for nearly every computer built since the late 1940s.\n\n---\n\n## Post-War Development and Programming Languages (1950s–1960s)\n\nThese innovators moved computing beyond specialized research and into practical application through memory, languages, and integrated circuits.\n\n11. **Grace Hopper (1906–1992):** A U.S. Navy rear admiral and pioneer in programming. She popularized the concept of machine-independent programming languages and developed the first **compiler** (A-0 System). She was instrumental in the development of **COBOL**.\n12. **Jack Kilby (1923–2005) & Robert Noyce (1927–1990):** Independently invented the **integrated circuit (IC)** or microchip in 1958/1959. This invention drastically reduced the size, cost, and power consumption of electronics, making modern computing possible.\n13. **John McCarthy (1927–2011):** Coined the term **\"Artificial Intelligence\"** in 1955 and invented the programming language **LISP**, which became foundational for AI research.\n14. **Donald Knuth (b. 1938):** Author of *The Art of Computer Programming*, a monumental work that synthesized the foundational mathematics of algorithms. He also invented the TeX typesetting system.\n\n---\n\n## The Personal Computer and Networking Revolution (1970s–1980s)\n\nThese figures brought computing out of specialized labs and into homes and offices.\n\n15. **Robert Metcalfe (b. 1941):** Co-inventor of **Ethernet**, the standard technology for local area networking (LANs), which was crucial for connecting early computers.\n16. **Ted Hoff (b. 1937), Federico Faggin (b. 1941), Stanley Mazor (b. 1934), and Masatoshi Shima (b. 1943):** Key designers at Intel who developed the **Intel 4004 (1971)**, the **first commercially available microprocessor**, placing all the central processing unit components onto a single chip.\n17. **Douglas Engelbart (1925–2013):** Demonstrated many fundamental concepts of modern personal computing in \"The Mother of All Demos\" (1968), including the **computer mouse**, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), hypertext linking, and networked collaboration.\n18. **Steve Jobs (1955–2011) & Steve Wozniak (b. 1950):** Co-founders of Apple. Wozniak engineered the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-market personal computers, while Jobs championed the productization and user experience that made PCs mainstream.\n19. **Bill Gates (b. 1955):** Co-founder of Microsoft. While not an inventor of hardware architecture, he and Paul Allen pioneered the software industry by creating mass-market operating systems (MS-DOS and Windows) that standardized the software interface for the vast majority of personal computers.",

It checks the HTTP status code, logs errors, attempts to parse JSON errors, and `raises_for_status()` for non-2xx codes, turning them into Python exceptions. This allows centralized error handling.\n4.  **API Interaction Functions (`get_resource`, `post_resource`, etc.):**\n    *   Each function (`get_resource`, `post_resource`, `put_resource`, `patch_resource`, `delete_resource`) wraps a specific `requests` method.\n    *   They construct the full URL, handle `params` (for GET query strings), `data` (for POST/PUT/PATCH request bodies), and `headers`.\n    *   They all include a `timeout` parameter to prevent indefinite waiting.\n    *   They use `try...except requests.exceptions.RequestException` to catch network-related errors (connection issues, timeouts, HTTP errors) gracefully.\n    *   `json=data`: For `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `requests` automatically serializes the Python dictionary `data` into JSON and sets the `Content-Type: application/json` header (unless you override it).\n5.  **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block:**\n    *   This block demonstrates how to use each of the API interaction functions.\n    *   It shows examples of:\n        *   Fetching all resources.\n        *   Fetching a single resource by ID.\n        *   Filtering resources using query parameters.\n        *   Creating a new resource.\n        *   Completely replacing a resource (PUT).\n        *   Partially updating a resource (PATCH).\n        *   Deleting a resource.\n    *   **Authentication Examples:** A conceptual section showing how to include API keys, Bearer tokens, or use Basic Authentication. You would uncomment and adapt these for your specific API's authentication method.\n    *   **Error Handling Demo:** Shows what happens when an invalid endpoint is requested.\n6.  **Logging:** Basic logging is set up to provide informational messages and error details.\n\n### Customizing for Your API\n\nTo adapt this script for *your* specific REST API:\n\n1.  **`BASE_URL`:** Change `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com` to your API's base URL.\n2.  **`ENDPOINT`:** Adjust the `ENDPOINT` variable and the `endpoint` arguments in the function calls to match your API's paths (e.g., `\"users\"`, `\"products\"`, `\"orders\"`).\n3.  **Request Body (`data`):** For `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, modify the `data` dictionaries to match the JSON structure your API expects.\n4.  **Query Parameters (`params`):** For `GET` requests that support filtering, sorting, or pagination, adjust the `params` dictionary accordingly.\n5.  **Headers:**\n    *   **Authentication:** Crucial for most real-world APIs. Use the `headers` parameter in the functions to pass API keys, `Authorization` (for Bearer tokens), or use the `auth` parameter for Basic Auth.\n    *   **Other Headers:** You might need to send custom headers (e.g., `X-Request-ID`, `Accept-Language`).\n6.  **`expected_status_codes`:** Review the `_handle_response` function's `expected_status_codes` list. While `[200, 201, 204]` are common, your API might return other success codes (e.g., 202 Accepted).\n7.  **Error Handling:** While `requests.exceptions.RequestException` and `_handle_response` provide robust generic error handling, you might want to add more specific logic based on common error responses from *your* API (e.g., parsing specific error codes or messages from the API's JSON error bodies).\n8.  **Return Values:** The functions currently return the JSON response or specific strings.

    "raw": "The **Doric Order** is the oldest and simplest of the classical Greek architectural orders. It is characterized by its massive, fluted columns resting directly on the stylobate (the platform of the temple) without a base, and its austere, sturdy appearance.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the key characteristics of the Doric Order:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Columns (The Shaft and Capital)\n\nThe Doric column is the most distinctive feature, conveying strength and simplicity.\n\n### A. The Column Shaft\n* **Fluting:** The shaft is deeply fluted (grooved) with sharp edges called **arris** separating the grooves. Classical Greek Doric columns typically have **20 flutes**.\n* **Entasis:** A subtle, convex swelling or bulge is often incorporated into the shaft about one-third of the way up from the base. This optical refinement prevents the straight column from appearing concave (a visual illusion) when viewed from a distance.\n* **No Base:** The Doric column sits directly on the temple floor (the **stylobate**) without an intervening base, making it seem firmly rooted to the ground.\n\n### B. The Capital\nThe capital is plain and functional, consisting of two main parts:\n1.  **Echinus:** A circular, convex cushion-like element that flares out slightly from the top of the shaft.\n2.  **Abacus:** A square, flat slab placed directly on top of the echinus, which serves as the bearing surface for the architrave above.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Entablature\nThe entablature is the structure supported by the columns, resting on the abacus. It is highly characteristic of the Doric Order.\n\n### A. Architrave\nThe lowest element resting directly on the columns. In the Doric style, the architrave is plain and undecorated, consisting of simple horizontal stone beams.\n\n### B. Frieze\nThe frieze, located above the architrave, is where the most recognizable Doric decoration occurs:\n*   **Triglyphs:** Vertical blocks containing three parallel, raised bands (giving the appearance of three grooves). These alternate with the metopes.\n*   **Metopes:** Square panels located between the triglyphs. These were often decorated in the earlier, older style with painted scenes or, more famously in the Parthenon, with sculpted reliefs depicting mythological battles.\n\n### C. Cornice\nThe projecting, crowning element of the entablature that shelters the frieze below.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Pediment\nThe triangular gable structure at the ends of the temple roof.\n*   The sloping edges of the roof form the **raking cornices**.\n*   The tympanum (the recessed area within the triangle) was often filled with large, freestanding sculptures, especially during the mature Classical period.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Key Visual Characteristics\n\n| Feature | Doric Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Overall Impression** | Masculine, sturdy, severe, simple. |\n| **Base** | Absent (sits directly on the stylobate). |\n| **Shaft** | Fluted with sharp arrises, often features entasis. |\n| **Capital** | Simple, consisting of an echinus and an abacus. |\n| **Frieze Decoration** | Alternating **Triglyphs** and **Metopes**. |\n| **Proportions** | Relatively short and stout compared to Ionic or Corinthian columns. |\n\n---\n\n## Historical Context and Evolution\n\nThe Doric Order originated in the Peloponnese region of Greece around the 7th century BCE.\n\n1.  **Archaic Doric (c. 600–480 BCE):** Characterized by very heavy, squat proportions, shallow fluting, and often a very exaggerated echinus (seen in early temples at Paestum, Italy).\n2.  **Classical Doric (c. 480–323 BCE):** Reached its peak perfection with the construction of the **Parthenon** in Athens. Proportions became more refined, elegant, and slender, and optical refinements (like entasis) were expertly applied.\n3.  **Roman Doric:** The Romans adopted the order but often modified it by adding a base to the column (a feature usually reserved for Ionic or Corinthian) and reducing the depth of the fluting.\n\n### Famous Examples:\n*   **The Parthenon, Athens, Greece** (The quintessential example of Classical Doric).\n*   **The Temple of Hephaestus, Athens, Greece** (One of the best-preserved Greek temples).\n*   **The Temple of Poseidon at Paestum, Italy** (Excellent example of Archaic Doric).",

    "raw": "# A Beginner's Guide to Understanding and Preventing SQL Injection\n\nSQL Injection (SQLi) is one of the oldest, most prevalent, and dangerous web application vulnerabilities. For anyone building or securing web applications, understanding SQLi is crucial. This guide will break down what it is, how it works, and most importantly, how to prevent it, even if you're just starting out.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is SQL Injection?\n\nLet's start with the basics:\n\n*   **SQL (Structured Query Language):** This is the language used to communicate with and manage relational databases. Almost every dynamic website relies on a database to store user information, product catalogs, blog posts, etc. When you log in, search for a product, or submit a comment, your web application sends SQL commands (called \"queries\") to the database.\n\n*   **Injection:** In the context of cybersecurity, \"injection\" refers to a type of attack where an attacker inserts malicious code into an input field, which is then processed by a program (in this case, a database).\n\n**Putting it together:** SQL Injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g., to dump the database contents to the attacker).\n\n---\n\n## 2. How Does SQL Injection Work? (The \"Injection\" Part)\n\nImagine a login form. When you type your username and password, the web application constructs an SQL query to check if your credentials are valid.\n\n**Scenario: A Vulnerable Login Form**\n\nLet's say a developer writes code that creates an SQL query by directly concatenating (joining) user input strings.\n\nHere's what a *typical, legitimate* query might look like behind the scenes when you enter `john` as the username and `password123` as the password:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john' AND password = 'password123';\n```\nIf these credentials match a record in the `users` table, you're logged in.\n\n**The Attack:**\n\nAn attacker exploits the application by entering carefully crafted input that changes the *meaning* of the SQL query.\n\n**Example 1: Bypassing Authentication**\n\nThe attacker might type the following into the **username** field:\n\n`admin' --`\n\n*(The `--` in SQL is a comment marker, meaning everything after it on the line is ignored by the database.)*\n\nNow, let's see how the vulnerable application builds the query:\n\n1.  **Original Query Structure:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '[user_input]' AND password = '[password_input]';`\n2.  **Attacker's Input:** `admin' --` for username, and anything for password (e.g., `blah`).\n3.  **Resulting Query:**\n    ```sql\n    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'blah';\n    ```\n\n**What the database sees:**\n\nThe database executes: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'`\n\nThe rest of the query (`--' AND password = 'blah';`) is commented out and ignored. If there's a user named `admin` in the database, the condition `username = 'admin'` becomes true, and the attacker is logged in as `admin` (or the first user returned if multiple match). No password needed!\n\n**Example 2: Retrieving All User Data**\n\nAnother common input for bypassing login or dumping data:\n\n`admin' OR '1'='1`\n\nWhen injected into the username field:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'blah';\n```\n\nSince `'1'='1'` is always true, the `OR '1'='1'` part makes the entire `WHERE` clause true. The database will return *all* rows from the `users` table, potentially logging the attacker in as the first user found, or revealing sensitive information.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Why is SQL Injection Dangerous?\n\nSQLi attacks can lead to severe consequences:\n\n*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can read, modify, or delete sensitive data (customer records, credit card numbers, passwords, personal information).\n*   **Data Corruption/Deletion:** Attackers can modify or destroy your database's data, causing significant damage and loss of trust.\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** As shown above, attackers can log in as legitimate users or administrators without knowing their credentials.\n*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify content displayed on your website.\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can make your website or application unavailable by corrupting data or overloading the database.\n*   **Remote Code Execution:** In some advanced cases, attackers can even execute arbitrary commands on the server itself, taking full control of the machine.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to Prevent SQL Injection (The Essential Defenses)\n\nPreventing SQLi primarily revolves around one core principle: **never treat user input as executable code.**\n\n### 1. **Parameterized Queries (The #1 Defense)**\n\nThis is the most effective and recommended way to prevent SQL injection. Parameterized queries (also known as Prepared Statements) work by separating the SQL code from the user-supplied data.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nInstead of directly embedding user input into the SQL string, you define the SQL query with \"placeholders\" for the input values. Then, you provide the user input separately, and the database engine understands that these inputs are *data* and not *code*. It will never interpret the input as part of the SQL command itself.\n\n**Analogy:** Think of it like filling out a pre-printed form. The structure of the form (the query) is fixed. You fill in the blanks (the parameters) with your information (the data). No matter what you write in the blanks, it's always treated as data, never as a change to the form's structure.\n\n**Example (Conceptual Code):**\n\nMost modern programming languages and database libraries support parameterized queries. Here's a conceptual example:\n\n```\n// Instead of this (VULNERABLE):\n// query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '\" + user_input + \"' AND password = '\" + pass_input + \"';\"\n// execute(query)\n\n// Do this (SECURE with Parameterized Query):\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?;\" // Or use named parameters like :username, :password\nparameters = [user_input, pass_input]\n\nexecute_prepared_statement(query, parameters)\n```\n\nIn this secure approach, if the attacker inputs `admin' --`, the database will simply search for a username that literally matches `admin' --`. It won't interpret `--` as a comment, and the login will fail (unless there's actually a user named `admin' --`).\n\n**Key Takeaway:** **Always use parameterized queries for *any* SQL query that incorporates user input.** This applies to `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.\n\n### 2. **Input Validation**\n\nWhile parameterized queries are your primary defense, robust input validation is a crucial secondary layer.\n\n*   **What it is:** Checking user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats, lengths, and types.\n*   **How to do it:**\n    *   **Data Type Validation:** If you expect a number, ensure it's a number.\n    *   **Length Validation:** Limit the length of input fields (e.g., usernames usually have a max length).\n    *   **Format Validation:** Use regular expressions to enforce specific patterns (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers, alphanumeric usernames).\n    *   **Whitelisting:** Only allow specific characters or values (e.g., a dropdown list).\n*   **Server-Side Validation:** Always perform validation on the server side. Client-side validation (in the browser) is good for user experience but can be bypassed by attackers.\n\n**Example:** If a username should only contain letters and numbers, validate that the input matches `^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$` before processing.\n\n### 3. **Principle of Least Privilege**\n\nDatabase users should only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    *   Your web application's database user should **NOT** be the database administrator (DBA).\n    *   It should only have `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` permissions on the specific tables it needs to interact with.\n    *   It should *not* have permissions to create tables, drop tables, or modify database schemas.\n    *   It definitely shouldn't have permissions to execute stored procedures that aren't directly part of its function.\n\n### 4. **Robust Error Handling**\n\nDon't display raw database errors to your users. Detailed error messages can inadvertently leak information about your database structure, operating system, and application logic, which attackers can use to craft more precise attacks.\n\n*   **Action:**\n    *   Catch database errors internally.\n    *   Log them securely on the server side for debugging.\n    *   Display generic, user-friendly error messages to the end-user (e.g., \"An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\").\n\n### 5. **Keep Software Up-to-Date**\n\nRegularly update your operating system, database software (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), web server, and application frameworks. Vendors frequently release security patches that fix known vulnerabilities, including potential SQLi vectors.\n\n### 6. **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**\n\nA Web Application Firewall can provide an additional layer of defense by monitoring and filtering HTTP traffic between your application and the internet. WAFs can detect and block many common attack patterns, including SQL injection attempts, before they even reach your application.\n\n*   **Note:** A WAF is a helpful *additional* layer, not a replacement for secure coding practices like parameterized queries.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSQL Injection remains a serious threat, but it's largely preventable with the right practices. As a beginner, focusing on **parameterized queries** should be your top priority for any application that interacts with a database. Combine this with diligent **input validation**, adherence to the **principle of least privilege**, and good **error handling**, and you'll be well on your way to building secure web applications.\n\nAlways remember: trust no input. All data coming from a user or external source should be treated as potentially malicious until proven otherwise.",

Calculate the Probability for Each Step\n\nSince the people board one by one without replacement, the total number of people and the number of women decrease with each successful boarding.\n\n**Event 1: The first person is a woman ($W_1$)**\n* Probability ($P(W_1)$) = (Number of women available) / (Total people available)\n$$P(W_1) = \\frac{7}{10}$$\n\n**Event 2: The second person is a woman ($W_2$), given the first was a woman**\nAfter the first woman boards:\n* Total people remaining: $10 - 1 = 9$\n* Women remaining: $7 - 1 = 6$\n* Probability ($P(W_2 | W_1)$) = $\\frac{6}{9}$\n\n**Event 3: The third person is a woman ($W_3$), given the first two were women**\nAfter the second woman boards:\n* Total people remaining: $9 - 1 = 8$\n* Women remaining: $6 - 1 = 5$\n* Probability ($P(W_3 | W_1 \\text{ and } W_2)$) = $\\frac{5}{8}$\n\n### 3. Calculate the Combined Probability\n\nThe probability that all three events happen in sequence is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{First three are women}) = P(W_1) \\times P(W_2 | W_1) \\times P(W_3 | W_1 \\text{ and } W_2)$$\n$$P = \\frac{7}{10} \\times \\frac{6}{9} \\times \\frac{5}{8}$$\n\nMultiply the numerators and the denominators:\n$$P = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{10 \\times 9 \\times 8} = \\frac{210}{720}$$\n\n### 4. Simplify the Result\n\nSimplify the fraction $\\frac{210}{720}$:\n$$P = \\frac{21}{72}$$\nBoth 21 and 72 are divisible by 3:\n$$P = \\frac{21 \\div 3}{72 \\div 3} = \\frac{7}{24}$$\n\n---\n### Alternative Method using Combinations\n\nThis problem can also be solved by calculating the ratio of favorable arrangements to total possible arrangements.\n\n**Total possible ways to choose the first 3 boarders (order matters):**\nThis is the permutation of 10 items taken 3 at a time ($P(10, 3)$).\n$$\\text{Total Arrangements} = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 720$$\n\n**Favorable ways (ways to choose 3 women in order):**\nThis is the permutation of 7 women taken 3 at a time ($P(7, 3)$).\n$$\\text{Favorable Arrangements} = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 = 210$$\n\n**Probability:**\n$$P = \\frac{\\text{Favorable Arrangements}}{\\text{Total Arrangements}} = \\frac{210}{720} = \\frac{7}{24}$$\n\nThe probability that the first three people to board the bus are all women is $\\mathbf{\\frac{7}{24}}$.",

    "raw": "Okay, I've cooked up a \"special problem\" for you. This one involves number theory, sequences, and a bit of careful deduction.\n\n---\n\n## The \"Smallest Sum Square\" Sequence\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nConsider a sequence of positive integers $(x_n)_{n \\ge 1}$ defined as follows:\n\n1.  $x_1 = 1$\n2.  For $n \\ge 1$, $x_{n+1}$ is the **smallest** integer such that $x_{n+1} > x_n$ and the sum $x_n + x_{n+1}$ is a perfect square.\n\n---\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n**(A) The Beginning:**\nDetermine the first five terms of the sequence: $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$. Show your work for how you find each term after $x_1$.\n\n**(B) The Conjectured Form:**\nBased on your findings in (A), propose a general formula for $x_n$ in terms of $n$.\n\n**(C) The Proof of Identity:**\nProve that your conjectured formula for $x_n$ is correct for all $n \\ge 1$.\n*Hint: Consider the sequence of perfect squares generated by $x_n + x_{n+1}$. What perfect square does $x_n + x_{n+1}$ evaluate to?*\n\n**(D) The Squares Themselves:**\nLet $S_n = x_n + x_{n+1}$. Show that $S_n = (n+1)^2$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\n---\n\n**Why it's Special:**\n\nThis problem combines sequential definition with a number theoretic constraint (\"perfect square\") and an optimization condition (\"smallest integer\"). The \"smallest integer\" condition is crucial and often leads to unique and elegant patterns that might not be immediately obvious. The solution involves pattern recognition and a solid proof strategy, likely using mathematical induction or a direct construction based on the properties of consecutive squares.\n\nGood luck! Let me know if you'd like to attempt it or see the solution.",

The study involved 100 office workers, 50 of whom were exposed to **bright, cool-white light** during the workday (Group A), and 50 of whom were exposed to **dim, warm-yellow light** during the workday (Group B).\n\nAfter three months, the sleep quality of all participants was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality. The average PSQI scores were calculated:\n\n*   **Group A (Bright, Cool-White Light):** Average PSQI Score = 4.5\n*   **Group B (Dim, Warm-Yellow Light):** Average PSQI Score = 6.8\n\n**Question 1:** Based on the results, which lighting condition appears to be associated with **better sleep quality**? Justify your answer using the provided data.\n\n**Question 2:** Formulate a **null hypothesis ($H_0$)** and an **alternative hypothesis ($H_8$)** for a statistical test that could be used to determine if the observed difference in mean PSQI scores between the two groups is statistically significant.\n\n**Question 3:** If the researchers wanted to replicate this study but only included participants who already reported mild sleep disturbances (PSQI scores between 5 and 10 before the study), what type of study design would this represent (e.g., independent groups, repeated measures, crossover, etc.) and why?",

Set $n=0$:\n$$1 = A(1)(2) + 0 + 0 \\implies 2A = 1 \\implies A = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n2. Set $n=-1$:\n$$1 = 0 + B(-1)(-1+2) + 0 \\implies 1 = B(-1)(1) \\implies -B = 1 \\implies B = -1$$\n\n3. Set $n=-2$:\n$$1 = 0 + 0 + C(-2)(-2+1) \\implies 1 = C(-2)(-1) \\implies 2C = 1 \\implies C = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n$$\\frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} = \\frac{1}{2n} - \\frac{1}{n+1} + \\frac{1}{2(n+2)}$$\n\nWe can group the terms to see the telescoping nature more clearly:\n$$\\frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right) - \\frac{1}{n+1}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{2}{n+1} + \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right)$$\n\nLet $S_N$ be the $N$-th partial sum:\n$$S_N = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{2}{n+1} + \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right)$$\n$$2S_N = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{2}{n+1} + \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right)$$\n\nLet's write out the first few terms of the sum $2S_N$:\n$n=1: \\quad \\left( \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = 1 - 1 + \\frac{1}{3}$\n$n=2: \\quad \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} \\right)$\n$n=3: \\quad \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} \\right)$\n$n=4: \\quad \\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} \\right)$\n...\n$n=N-1: \\left( \\frac{1}{N-1} - \\frac{2}{N} + \\frac{1}{N+1} \\right)$\n$n=N: \\quad \\left( \\frac{1}{N} - \\frac{2}{N+1} + \\frac{1}{N+2} \\right)$\n\nLet's sum the columns vertically:\nThe coefficient of $\\frac{1}{k}$ comes from the terms where $n=k$, $n+1=k$ (i.e., $n=k-1$), and $n+2=k$ (i.e., $n=k-2$).\n\nFor $k \\ge 3$:\nCoefficient of $\\frac{1}{k}$ is $1$ (from $n=k$) $- 2$ (from $n=k-1$) $+ 1$ (from $n=k-2$) $= 0$.\n\nWe only need to look at the beginning and the end terms.\n\nTerms remaining from the beginning ($n=1, 2$):\n$n=1$: $1 - 1 + \\frac{1}{3}$\n$n=2$: $\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nCombining the coefficients for small indices:\n$\\frac{1}{1}$: Appears only in $n=1$ with coefficient $+1$. (Total $= 1$)\n$\\frac{1}{2}$: Appears in $n=1$ with coefficient $-2$ and in $n=2$ with coefficient $+1$. (Total $= -2 + 1 = -1$)\n$\\frac{1}{3}$: Appears in $n=1$ with coefficient $+1$, in $n=2$ with coefficient $-2$, and in $n=3$ with coefficient $+1$.

(Total coefficient $1 - 2 + 1 = 0$)\n\nThe final surviving terms (for large $N$) are:\n$$(-1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{N+1} + (1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{N+2}$$\n\nThe partial sum $2S_N$ is:\n$$2S_N = \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\left( - \\frac{1}{N+1} + \\frac{1}{N+2} \\right)$$\n$$2S_N = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{N+1} + \\frac{1}{N+2}$$\n\nTo find the infinite sum $S$, we take the limit as $N \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} 2S_N = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{N+1} + \\frac{1}{N+2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - 0 + 0 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSince $2S = \\frac{1}{2}$, the sum $S$ is:\n$$S = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThe value of the expression is $\\frac{1}{4}$, which corresponds to option A.",
