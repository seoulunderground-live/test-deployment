    "raw": "To solve this problem, we need to perform two main steps:\n\n1.  **Find the starting term of the sum (`n-k`):** This is defined as the first non-negative multiple of 7 that is less than or equal to `n`.\n2.  **Calculate the sum:** Once we have the starting term, we sum all integers from that term up to `n`. This is an arithmetic series.\n\nLet's break down each step:\n\n### Step 1: Find the `start_value`\n\nThe `start_value` is `n-k`.\nIf `n` is a multiple of 7, then `n-k` is `n`.\nIf `n` is not a multiple of 7, we need to subtract its remainder when divided by 7.\n\nThis can be concisely calculated as:\n`start_value = n - (n % 7)`\n\nExamples:\n*   If `n = 10`: `10 % 7 = 3`. `start_value = 10 - 3 = 7`. (Correct, 7 is the largest multiple of 7 <= 10).\n*   If `n = 7`: `7 % 7 = 0`. `start_value = 7 - 0 = 7`. (Correct).\n*   If `n = 6`: `6 % 7 = 6`. `start_value = 6 - 6 = 0`. (Correct, 0 is the largest multiple of 7 <= 6).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the arithmetic series\n\nWe need to sum the integers from `start_value` to `n`.\nThis is an arithmetic progression with:\n*   First term (`a`): `start_value`\n*   Last term (`l`): `n`\n*   Number of terms (`count`): `n - start_value + 1`\n\nThe sum `S` of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:\n`S = (count / 2) * (first_term + last_term)`\n\nSubstituting our values:\n`S = ((n - start_value + 1) / 2) * (start_value + n)`\n\n### Example Walkthrough (`n = 10`)\n\n1.  **Find `start_value`:**\n    `n = 10`\n    `start_value = 10 - (10 % 7) = 10 - 3 = 7`\n    So, the sum will be `10 + 9 + 8 + 7`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the sum:**\n    *   `first_term = 7`\n    *   `last_term = 10`\n    *   `count = 10 - 7 + 1 = 4`\n    *   `S = (4 / 2) * (7 + 10) = 2 * 17 = 34`\n\nThis matches the example output.\n\n### Python Implementation\n\n```python\ndef calculate_special_sum(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 'special sum' for a given positive integer n.\n\n    The special sum is n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + (n-k),\n    where (n-k) is the first non-negative multiple of 7 less than or equal to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n: A positive integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        The calculated special sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input n must be a positive integer.\")\n\n    # Step 1: Find the first non-negative multiple of 7 less than or equal to n\n    # This is equivalent to n - (n % 7)\n    start_value = n - (n % 7)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the sum of the arithmetic series\n    # The series runs from start_value up to n (inclusive).\n    # First term (a) = start_value\n    # Last term (l) = n\n    # Number of terms (count) = (last_term - first_term + 1)\n    \n    count = n - start_value + 1\n\n    # Sum of an arithmetic series S = (count / 2) * (first_term + last_term)\n    # Using integer division `//` is safe here because the sum of an integer\n    # series will always be an integer, and the product `count * (start_value + n)`\n    # will always be an even number if `count` or `(start_value + n)` is even.\n    # If both `count` and `(start_value + n)` are odd, it means `count` is odd and\n    # `start_value + n` is odd. This implies `start_value` and `n` have different parity.\n    # However, for an arithmetic series `start_value, start_value+1, ..., n`,\n    # the sum `S = count * (start_value + n) / 2` will always be an integer.\n    # So `(count * (start_value + n)) // 2` is correct.\n    special_sum = (count * (start_value + n)) // 2\n\n    return special_sum\n\n# Test cases\nprint(f\"n = 10, Special Sum: {calculate_special_sum(10)}\") # Expected: 34 (10+9+8+7)\nprint(f\"n = 7, Special Sum: {calculate_special_sum(7)}\")   # Expected: 7\nprint(f\"n = 6, Special Sum: {calculate_special_sum(6)}\")   # Expected: 21 (6+5+4+3+2+1+0)\nprint(f\"n = 1, Special Sum: {calculate_special_sum(1)}\")   # Expected: 1 (1+0)\nprint(f\"n = 14, Special Sum: {calculate_special_sum(14)}\") # Expected: 105 (14+13+...+0)\nprint(f\"n = 0, Special Sum: {calculate_special_sum(0)}\")   # Expected: 0 (if 0 is allowed, 0 is mult of 7)\n```",

    "raw": "To find the longest string in a list of strings in Python, the most Pythonic and efficient way is to use the built-in `max()` function with a `key` argument. The `key` argument specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the iterable. In this case, we want to compare strings by their length, so `len` is the appropriate key.\n\nHere's the Python function:\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_string(string_list: list[str]) -> str | None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest string in a given list of strings.\n\n    If there are multiple strings with the same maximum length,\n    the function returns the first one encountered (based on max() behavior).\n\n    Args:\n        string_list: A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        The longest string from the list.\n        Returns None if the input list is empty or None.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not string_list:  # Handles empty list and None input\n        return None\n    \n    # max() with key=len finds the item with the maximum length\n    return max(string_list, key=len)\n\n# --- Examples ---\n\n# Example 1: Basic usage\nlist1 = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"kiwi\", \"grapefruit\", \"orange\"]\nlongest1 = find_longest_string(list1)\nprint(f\"List: {list1}\\nLongest string: '{longest1}'\\n\")\n\n# Example 2: List with ties for longest length (returns the first one encountered)\nlist2 = [\"cat\", \"dog\", \"elephant\", \"tiger\", \"zebra\"]\nlongest2 = find_longest_string(list2)\nprint(f\"List: {list2}\\nLongest string: '{longest2}'\\n\") # Expected: 'elephant'\n\n# Example 3: List containing empty strings\nlist3 = [\"\", \"a\", \"bb\", \"\", \"ccc\"]\nlongest3 = find_longest_string(list3)\nprint(f\"List: {list3}\\nLongest string: '{longest3}'\\n\") # Expected: 'ccc'\n\n# Example 4: List with all empty strings\nlist4 = [\"\", \"\", \"\"]\nlongest4 = find_longest_string(list4)\nprint(f\"List: {list4}\\nLongest string: '{longest4}'\\n\") # Expected: ''\n\n# Example 5: List with a single string\nlist5 = [\"hello\"]\nlongest5 = find_longest_string(list5)\nprint(f\"List: {list5}\\nLongest string: '{longest5}'\\n\") # Expected: 'hello'\n\n# Example 6: Empty list\nlist6 = []\nlongest6 = find_longest_string(list6)\nprint(f\"List: {list6}\\nLongest string: {longest6}\\n\") # Expected: None\n\n# Example 7: None input (though type hint suggests list[str])\nlist7 = None\nlongest7 = find_longest_string(list7)\nprint(f\"List: {list7}\\nLongest string: {longest7}\\n\") # Expected: None\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1.  **`def find_longest_string(string_list: list[str]) -> str | None:`**\n    *   Defines a function named `find_longest_string` that accepts one argument, `string_list`.\n    *   `list[str]` is a type hint indicating that `string_list` is expected to be a list of strings.\n    *   `-> str | None` is a type hint indicating that the function is expected to return either a string or `None`.\n\n2.  **`if not string_list:`**\n    *   This is an important edge case check. If `string_list` is empty (`[]`) or `None`, it evaluates to `True`.\n    *   In such cases, there's no string to return, so the function returns `None`.\n\n3.  **`return max(string_list, key=len)`**\n    *   This is the core of the solution.\n    *   `max()` is a built-in Python function that returns the largest item in an iterable.\n    *   `key=len` tells `max()` to use the length of each string as the criterion for comparison, rather than the strings themselves (which would compare them lexicographically).\n    *   For example, if `string_list` is `[\"apple\", \"banana\", \"kiwi\"]`:\n        *   `len(\"apple\")` is 5\n        *   `len(\"banana\")` is 6\n        *   `len(\"kiwi\")` is 4\n    *   `max()` will compare these lengths and return the string corresponding to the maximum length, which is \"banana\".\n    *   If multiple strings have the same maximum length (e.g., \"apple\" and \"grape\"), `max()` will return the first one it encounters in the list.",

    "raw": "**LLM stands for Large Language Model.**\n\nIn essence, an LLM is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) program that is specifically designed to **understand, generate, and process human language** in a highly sophisticated way.\n\nLet's break down what each part of the name signifies:\n\n1.  **Large:**\n    *   **Vast Amount of Data:** LLMs are trained on enormous datasets of text and code. This data is typically scraped from the internet and includes billions, even trillions, of words from books, articles, websites, conversations, code repositories, and more.\n    *   **Numerous Parameters:** These models contain billions, sometimes trillions, of \"parameters.\" Parameters are the weights and biases in the neural network that allow the model to learn and store complex patterns, relationships, grammar rules, and factual information from the vast training data. More parameters generally mean a more complex and capable model.\n\n2.  **Language:**\n    *   Their primary function is to work with human language (natural language). They learn grammar, syntax, semantics (the meaning of words and phrases), context, and even some forms of reasoning by analyzing how words and phrases are used together across massive amounts of text.\n\n3.  **Model:**\n    *   They are a type of artificial neural network, most commonly built using the **Transformer architecture**. This architecture is particularly effective at processing sequential data like text, allowing the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence and understand long-range dependencies.\n\n**How they work (Simplified):**\nAt their core, LLMs are trained to predict the next word or \"token\" (a piece of a word, a whole word, or punctuation) in a sequence, given the preceding words. By repeatedly performing this task on massive datasets, they develop an intricate statistical understanding of language and context, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.\n\n**Key Capabilities of LLMs:**\n\n*   **Text Generation:** Writing articles, stories, emails, code, poems, scripts, and more based on a given prompt.\n*   **Summarization:** Condensing long texts or documents into shorter, coherent summaries.\n*   **Translation:** Converting text from one language to another.\n*   **Question Answering:** Providing relevant answers to a wide range of questions based on their learned knowledge.\n*   **Conversation:** Engaging in natural, human-like dialogue (the basis for chatbots and conversational AI).\n*   **Code Generation and Debugging:** Writing code in various programming languages, suggesting fixes, or explaining code.\n*   **Creative Writing:** Generating creative content in various styles and formats.\n*   **Information Extraction:** Identifying and extracting specific pieces of information from text.\n*   **Reasoning (Pattern-Based):** Inferring information, solving problems, and performing logical tasks based on the patterns learned during training, though not true human-like reasoning.\n\n**Training Process (Briefly):**\n1.  **Pre-training:** The model learns general language patterns by processing massive amounts of text in a self-supervised manner (e.g., predicting missing words or the next word).\n2.  **Fine-tuning:** The pre-trained model is then often refined on smaller, more specific datasets for particular tasks or to align its behavior (e.g., through **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback - RLHF**) with human preferences for helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty.\n\nLLMs like OpenAI's GPT series, Google's Bard/Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude have revolutionized the field of AI, enabling applications that were previously impossible and making advanced language capabilities accessible to a wide audience.",

    "raw": "## How-To Guide: Effective and Ethical AI Integration\n\nIntegrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into an organization is a transformative journey that promises significant advantages but also carries substantial responsibilities. This guide outlines a systematic approach to ensure your AI initiatives are not only effective in achieving business goals but also ethically sound, responsible, and sustainable.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 1: Strategic Planning & Vision (The \"Why\" and \"What\")\n\nThis foundational phase sets the direction and ensures AI adoption aligns with core business objectives and values.\n\n1.  **Define Clear Objectives & Value Proposition:**\n    *   **Effectiveness:** Identify specific business problems AI can solve (e.g., automate repetitive tasks, enhance customer experience, optimize operations, generate insights). Quantify potential ROI (cost savings, revenue growth, efficiency gains).\n    *   **Ethics:** Consider the *human impact* from the outset. How will AI affect employees, customers, and other stakeholders? What societal value might it create or diminish?\n\n2.  **Conduct a Readiness Assessment:**\n    *   **Effectiveness:** Evaluate current data infrastructure, data quality, IT capabilities, and existing skill sets. Identify gaps in data availability, accessibility, and cleanliness.\n    *   **Ethics:** Assess organizational culture regarding data privacy, transparency, and accountability. Identify potential areas of historical bias in data or processes.\n\n3.  **Establish an AI Governance Framework:**\n    *   **Effectiveness:** Define clear roles and responsibilities for AI initiatives (e.g., data scientists, engineers, business analysts, legal, ethics committee).\n    *   **Ethics:** Develop internal AI principles and policies that align with company values and external regulations (e.g., GDPR, local AI guidelines). This framework should cover data privacy, fairness, transparency, accountability, and security.\n\n4.  **Start Small, Think Big:**\n    *   **Effectiveness:** Begin with pilot projects or Proofs of Concept (PoCs) that have a high likelihood of success and measurable impact. This builds confidence and demonstrates value.\n    *   **Ethics:** Use early projects as learning opportunities to refine ethical guidelines and identify unforeseen challenges in a contained environment.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Foundational Pillars & Preparation (The \"How-To Prepare\")\n\nThis phase focuses on building the necessary infrastructure, capabilities, and guidelines.\n\n1.  **Data Strategy & Management:**\n    *   **Effectiveness:** Implement robust data governance processes for data collection, storage, cleansing, labeling, and access. Ensure data quality and relevance for AI models.\n    *   **Ethics:** Prioritize data privacy and security (encryption, access controls). Implement strategies for identifying and mitigating biases in training data (e.g., diverse data sources, re-weighting, synthetic data).

Creates a directory `mycoolproject`.\n2.  Changes into that directory.\n3.  Creates `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `.env` inside `mycoolproject`.\n4.  Builds the Docker image for the `web` service.\n5.  Runs `django-admin startproject mycoolproject .` inside a temporary container, creating your Django project structure.\n6.  Modifies `mycoolproject/settings.py` to correctly read database, `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` from the `.env` file using `django-environ`.\n7.  Starts the `web` and `db` services in detached mode (`-d`).\n8.  Executes `python manage.py migrate` inside the `web` container to set up your database.\n9.  Finally, it gives you instructions on how to create a superuser and access your new Django application.\n\n### After the script finishes:\n\n1.  Navigate into your new project directory:\n    ```bash\n    cd mycoolproject\n    ```\n2.  Create a Django superuser (you'll be prompted for username, email, and password):\n    ```bash\n    docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser\n    ```\n3.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the Django welcome page.\n4.  To access the admin panel, go to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and log in with the superuser credentials you just created.\n\n### To stop and clean up (optional):\n\n```bash\ncd mycoolproject\ndocker compose down -v # -v removes the postgres_data volume\n```",

    "raw": "As a digital nomad, finding long-term accommodation (generally 1 month+) is a different game than booking a short vacation rental. It requires more planning, due diligence, and often a more local approach. This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n## The Digital Nomad's Guide to Finding Long-Term Accommodation\n\n### I. Pre-Departure & Planning (The Foundation)\n\nBefore you even start looking, define what \"long-term\" means to you and what you need.\n\n1.  **Define Your Needs & Priorities:**\n    *   **Duration:** 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, a year? This impacts platform choice and lease types.\n    *   **Budget:** Be realistic. Factor in rent, utilities (electricity, water, gas, internet), potential deposit, and any cleaning fees.\n    *   **Location:** City center, quiet neighborhood, near parks, close to coworking spaces, good public transport access?\n    *   **Property Type:** Apartment, co-living space, house, room in a shared flat?\n    *   **Amenities:**\n        *   **Crucial for Nomads:** Reliable high-speed internet (ask for speed test screenshots!), dedicated workspace, comfortable chair.\n        *   **Desirable:** Air conditioning/heating, laundry facilities, fully equipped kitchen, natural light, balcony/outdoor space, gym access.\n    *   **Community:** Do you want to be in a vibrant expat hub, a local neighborhood, or a co-living space with built-in community?\n\n2.  **Research Your Destination Thoroughly:**\n    *   **Cost of Living:** Beyond rent, understand food, transport, and leisure costs.\n    *   **Visa Requirements:** For stays over 30/60/90 days, you *will* need a specific visa (tourist visas rarely allow long-term residency or work). This is critical and often overlooked by new nomads.\n    *   **Local Culture & Etiquette:** Understand how rentals work, common scams, and landlord-tenant relationships.\n    *   **Safety:** Research neighborhood safety.\n\n3.  **Timing is Key:**\n    *   **Off-Season vs. Peak Season:** Prices fluctuate significantly. Aim for off-peak if flexibility allows.\n    *   **Booking Window:** For long-term, 1-3 months in advance is often ideal, but sometimes last-minute deals can be found.\n\n### II. Where to Look (The Hunt)\n\nA combination of online and sometimes offline methods is best.\n\n1.  **Online Platforms (Short-Term to Mid-Term Stays - 1-6 Months):**\n    *   **Airbnb/Booking.com:**\n        *   **Pros:** Easy to use, reviews, host communication, often fully furnished, monthly discounts (filter by \"monthly stays\").\n        *   **Cons:** Can be expensive for very long stays, typically caters to tourists.\n        *   **Tip:** Use them for an initial 1-2 week \"landing pad\" while you search locally, or negotiate directly with hosts for longer terms outside the platform *after* your initial booking.\n    *   **Nomad-Specific Platforms:**\n        *   **Flatio / Homelike / Anyplace / Blueground:** Designed for mid-to-long term furnished rentals for professionals and nomads. Offer vetted properties and easier contracts.\n        *   **Co-living Spaces (e.g., Selina, Outsite, local co-living brands):** Offer private rooms with shared amenities, often a built-in community and workspace. Great for networking and ease of settling in.\n    *   **Facebook Groups:**\n        *   **Local Expats/Digital Nomads Groups:** Search \"Expats in [City Name]\", \"Digital Nomads [City Name]\", or \"[City Name] Housing/Rentals.\" These are goldmines for direct listings, sublets, and local advice.\n        *   **Local Rental Groups:** Search for groups specifically for apartment rentals in your target city/neighborhood.\n    *   **General Rental Portals (Country/Region Specific):**\n        *   **Europe:** Idealista (Spain, Portugal, Italy), SeLoger (France), WG-Gesucht.de (Germany, especially for rooms), Funda (Netherlands).\n        *   **Asia:** PropertyGuru (SEA), local real estate agent websites.\n        *   **Latin America:** Inmobilairia.com (Mexico), ZonaProp (Argentina), local realtor sites.\n        *   *These often require more engagement with local agents and understanding of local lease terms.*\n\n2.  **Offline Strategies (Once You Arrive - especially for 6+ months):**\n    *   **Local Real Estate Agents:**\n        *   **Pros:** Access to more traditional long-term leases, legal guidance, often find properties not listed online.\n        *   **Cons:** Can be expensive (agent fees), require more paperwork, leases often in local language, may require a local bank account/tax ID.\n    *   **Word of Mouth:** Network with other nomads, expats, or locals in coworking spaces, cafes, or social events.\n    *   **\"For Rent\" Signs:** Walk around your preferred neighborhoods. Less common now but still exists.\n    *   **University/Community Boards:** Sometimes have room rental listings.\n\n### III. Vetting & Due Diligence (Don't Get Scammed!)\n\nThis is where you protect yourself.\n\n1.  **Verify the Listing and Host/Landlord:**\n    *   **Reviews:** Always read reviews on platforms.\n    *   **Video Tours:** Ask for a live video call tour of the property if you can't see it in person. Photos can be misleading or outdated.\n    *   **Legitimacy:** If dealing directly, check the landlord's name/contact info against public records if possible (e.g., reverse image search profile picture).\n    *   **Meeting in Person:** If you're on the ground, always meet the landlord/agent and view the property before committing.\n\n2.  **Clarify All Terms & Costs:**\n    *   **Rent:** Confirm monthly amount, payment date, and preferred payment method (bank transfer, PayPal, local app).\n    *   **Deposit:** How much, when is it due, under what conditions is it returned? Will it be held in an escrow account (common in some countries)?\n    *   **Utilities:** Are they included or extra? If extra, what's the average monthly cost? How are they paid?\n    *   **Internet:** Confirm speed, reliability, and if it's included.\n    *   **Lease Term & Notice Period:** How long is the contract? What's the notice period if you need to leave early or extend? Are there any break clauses?\n    *   **Rules:** Any specific rules about guests, pets, noise, etc.?\n\n3.  **Read the Contract/Agreement Carefully:**\n    *   **Get it in Writing:** NEVER agree to anything verbally for long-term stays.\n    *   **Language:** If not in English, use Google Translate or, ideally, have a local friend/lawyer review it.\n    *   **Understand Every Clause:** Especially those related to deposits, repairs, notice, and eviction.\n    *   **Photos/Inventory:** Take detailed photos/videos of the property's condition *before* moving in. This protects your deposit upon moving out.\n\n4.  **Be Aware of Scams:**\n    *   **Too Good to Be True:** If the price is significantly lower than similar properties, be suspicious.\n    *   **Pressure Tactics:** Anyone pressuring you to pay immediately without seeing the property or signing a contract.\n    *   **Requests for Wire Transfers:** Especially to personal accounts in different countries. Use secure payment methods.\n    *   **\"Landlord is Out of the Country\":** A classic. They'll send you keys after you pay. Don't fall for it.\n    *   **No Property Viewings:** If they refuse to show you the property (in person or via video call), it's a red flag.\n\n### IV. Securing Your Stay (The Logistics)\n\nOnce you've found your ideal spot and done your due diligence.\n\n1.  **Payment:**\n    *   **Deposit & First Month's Rent:** Be prepared to pay these upfront.\n    *   **Payment Method:** Discuss preferred method. For international transfers, consider services like Wise (formerly TransferWise) for better rates than traditional banks.\n    *   **Receipts:** Always get a receipt for all payments made.\n\n2.  **Contract Signing:**\n    *   **Digital vs. Physical:** Many platforms offer digital contracts. For direct rentals, you might sign a physical lease.\n    *   **Keep a Copy:** Ensure you have a signed copy of the entire agreement.\n\n3.  **Utilities Setup (If not included):**\n    *   You might need to set up accounts for electricity, gas, or water. The landlord or agent should assist with this.\n    *   Local SIM card is essential for connectivity.\n\n### V. Arrival & Settling In (Making it Home)\n\n1.  **Initial Check:** Immediately upon arrival, do a thorough check against your inventory photos. Report any new damage or discrepancies to the landlord/agent immediately and in writing.\n2.  **Local Essentials:** Get a local SIM card, locate essential services (supermarket, pharmacy, public transport), and familiarize yourself with the neighborhood.\n3.  **Internet Test:** Confirm internet speed and reliability on day one. If it's not as promised, address it immediately.\n4.  **Connect:** Join local expat/nomad groups, visit coworking spaces, or attend local events to build your community.\n\n### VI. Ongoing Management & Future Planning\n\n1.  **Be a Good Tenant:** Respect the property and your neighbors. Promptly report any maintenance issues.\n2.  **Plan Ahead:** If you intend to renew or move, start looking 1-2 months before your current lease ends.\n3.  **Departure Protocol:** Understand the cleaning requirements, inventory check-out process, and timeline for deposit return. Take photos/videos upon departure to document the property's condition.\n\n---\n\nFinding long-term accommodation as a digital nomad takes effort, but the reward is a comfortable, stable base that allows you to truly immerse yourself in a new location. Happy hunting!",

    "raw": "The problem requires us to sort an array of integers with a special rule: all even numbers should come before all odd numbers. Additionally, within the even numbers, they should be sorted in ascending order, and within the odd numbers, they should also be sorted in ascending order.\n\nLet's break down the requirements and then devise a strategy.\n\n**Requirements:**\n1.  **Even before Odd:** Numbers like `[2, 4]` must appear before numbers like `[1, 3]`.\n2.  **Ascending Even:** `[4, 2]` should become `[2, 4]`.\n3.  **Ascending Odd:** `[3, 1]` should become `[1, 3]`.\n\n**Strategy 1: Separate, Sort, and Merge**\n\nThis is often the most straightforward and readable approach for problems involving different sorting criteria for subsets of data.\n\n1.  **Separate:** Iterate through the input array and categorize each number into one of two lists: `even_numbers` or `odd_numbers`.\n2.  **Sort:** Sort the `even_numbers` list in ascending order. Sort the `odd_numbers` list in ascending order.\n3.  **Merge:** Concatenate the sorted `even_numbers` list with the sorted `odd_numbers` list. This will be our final result.\n\n**Example Walkthrough:**\n\nLet `arr = [4, 2, 1, 3]`\n\n1.  **Separate:**\n    *   `even_numbers = []`\n    *   `odd_numbers = []`\n    *   `4` is even -> `even_numbers = [4]`\n    *   `2` is even -> `even_numbers = [4, 2]`\n    *   `1` is odd -> `odd_numbers = [1]`\n    *   `3` is odd -> `odd_numbers = [1, 3]`\n\n2.  **Sort:**\n    *   Sort `even_numbers`: `[4, 2]` becomes `[2, 4]`\n    *   Sort `odd_numbers`: `[1, 3]` remains `[1, 3]`\n\n3.  **Merge:**\n    *   `result = [2, 4] + [1, 3]`\n    *   `result = [2, 4, 1, 3]`\n\n---\n\n**Python Implementation (Strategy 1)**\n\n```python\ndef special_sort(arr):\n    even_numbers = []\n    odd_numbers = []\n\n    # Step 1: Separate even and odd numbers\n    for num in arr:\n        if num % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even\n            even_numbers.append(num)\n        else:  # The number is odd\n            odd_numbers.append(num)\n\n    # Step 2: Sort both lists in ascending order\n    even_numbers.sort() # In-place sort\n    odd_numbers.sort()   # In-place sort\n\n    # Step 3: Merge the sorted lists (even numbers first, then odd numbers)\n    return even_numbers + odd_numbers\n\n```\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   Separating: `O(N)` because we iterate through the input array once.\n    *   Sorting `even_numbers`: `O(E log E)`, where `E` is the number of even numbers.\n    *   Sorting `odd_numbers`: `O(O log O)`, where `O` is the number of odd numbers.\n    *   Merging: `O(E + O)`, which is `O(N)`.\n    *   Overall, since `E <= N` and `O <= N`, the dominant factor is sorting, so the total time complexity is `O(N log N)`.\n\n*   **Space Complexity:**\n    *   `O(N)` because we create two new lists (`even_numbers` and `odd_numbers`) to store all elements from the input array.\n\n---\n\n**Alternative Strategy 2: Custom Comparator (using `sorted()` with a `key`)**\n\nIn Python, you can use the `sorted()` function with a `key` argument. The `key` function should return a value (or a tuple of values) that `sorted()` will use for comparison. We can make even numbers \"prioritized\" by giving them a lower priority value in a tuple.\n\n```python\ndef special_sort_comparator(arr):\n    # Define a custom key function for sorting\n    def custom_key(num):\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            # Even numbers: priority 0, then sort by the number itself\n            return (0, num)\n        else:\n            # Odd numbers: priority 1, then sort by the number itself\n            return (1, num)\n\n    # Use sorted() with the custom key\n    return sorted(arr, key=custom_key)\n\n```\n\n**Explanation of `custom_key`:**\nWhen `sorted()` uses this `custom_key` function, it will create tuples for each number in the array. For example:\n*   `4` becomes `(0, 4)`\n*   `2` becomes `(0, 2)`\n*   `1` becomes `(1, 1)`\n*   `3` becomes `(1, 3)`\n\nPython's tuple comparison works element by element.\n1.  It first compares the first element of the tuples (the priority: `0` for even, `1` for odd). Since `0 < 1`, all even numbers will naturally come before all odd numbers.\n2.  If the first elements are equal (e.g., comparing two even numbers `(0, 4)` and `(0, 2)`), it then compares the second elements (the actual numbers `4` and `2`). This ensures ascending order within the evens and within the odds.\n\nThis approach also has `O(N log N)` time complexity and `O(N)` space complexity (for the new list returned by `sorted()`). It's often considered more \"Pythonic\" for complex sorting requirements.\n\nBoth strategies are effective and valid for solving this problem. The \"Separate, Sort, Merge\" is perhaps more explicit in its steps, while the \"Custom Comparator\" is more concise once you understand the `key` function concept.",

    "raw": "Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are a broad category of tools and techniques designed to protect an individual's personal data and activities, often by minimizing the collection of personal information, anonymizing data, or securing its processing and transmission.\n\nHere's a list of key technologies developed for privacy, categorized for clarity:\n\n---\n\n### I. Data Protection & Anonymization\n\nThese technologies aim to prevent the re-identification of individuals from datasets or reduce the sensitivity of data.\n\n1.  **Differential Privacy (DP):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Adds a carefully calibrated amount of random noise to data before it's released or used for analysis, making it statistically difficult to infer information about any single individual while preserving overall data utility.\n    *   **Examples:** Used by Google, Apple, Microsoft, and the U.S. Census Bureau for data analysis.\n\n2.  **K-anonymity, L-diversity, T-closeness:**\n    *   **Purpose:** Data anonymization techniques that group individuals into cohorts (k-anonymity), ensure diversity of sensitive attributes within those cohorts (l-diversity), or ensure the distribution of sensitive attributes is close to the overall distribution (t-closeness) to prevent re-identification.\n    *   **Examples:** Used in health records, demographic data, or any dataset requiring de-identification.\n\n3.  **Data Masking/Tokenization:**\n    *   **Purpose:** Replaces sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, SSNs) with non-sensitive, unique identifiers (tokens) or masked values (e.g., showing only the last four digits).\n    *   **Examples:** Used in payment processing, call centers, and database security.\n\n4.  **Data Minimization/Generalization:**\n    *   **Purpose:** Collecting and retaining only the absolutely necessary data, or generalizing specific data points into broader categories (e.g., age \"30-35\" instead of \"32\").\n    *   **Examples:** A core principle in GDPR and other privacy regulations, applied across various data collection scenarios.\n\n---\n\n### II. Secure Communication & Network Anonymity\n\nThese focus on protecting the content and metadata of communications and online activities.\n\n1.  **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Encrypts messages on the sender's device and decrypts them only on the recipient's device, ensuring that only the sender and intended recipient can read the messages.\n    *   **Examples:** Signal Protocol (used in Signal, WhatsApp, Threema), PGP/GPG for email, Apple's iMessage.\n\n2.  **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Creates an encrypted tunnel between a user's device and a VPN server, masking the user's IP address and encrypting their internet traffic from their ISP and other third parties.\n    *   **Examples:** NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Proton VPN.\n\n3.  **Tor (The Onion Router):**\n    *   **Purpose:** An anonymity network that routes internet traffic through a series of relays run by volunteers worldwide, encrypting it multiple times to conceal the user's location and usage from traffic analysis.\n    *   **Examples:** Tor Browser, used for anonymous web browsing and accessing onion services.\n\n4.  **Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Provides encryption for data transmitted over computer networks, primarily used to secure communication between web browsers and servers (HTTPS).\n    *   **Examples:** The \"S\" in HTTPS, securing virtually all sensitive web traffic (online banking, shopping, email).\n\n5.  **DNS over HTTPS (DoH) / DNS over TLS (DoT):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Encrypts DNS (Domain Name System) queries, preventing third parties (like ISPs) from seeing which websites a user is trying to access.\n    *   **Examples:** Supported by modern browsers (Firefox, Chrome), Cloudflare, Google Public DNS.\n\n---\n\n### III. Privacy-Preserving Computation\n\nThese allow computations or analysis to be performed on data without directly exposing the raw data.\n\n1.  **Homomorphic Encryption (HE):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first. The result of the computation remains encrypted and, when decrypted, is the same as if the operations were performed on the plaintext.\n    *   **Examples:** Research and development for cloud computing where data needs to remain encrypted, secure genomic data analysis.\n\n2.  **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC/MPC):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Enables multiple parties to jointly compute a function on their private inputs without revealing their individual inputs to each other.\n    *   **Examples:** Secure voting systems, private aggregation of statistics (e.g., salary benchmarks across companies), secure auctions.\n\n3.  **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Hardware-isolated regions within a processor (enclaves) that provide strong security guarantees for data and code even if the rest of the system is compromised. Data processed within a TEE remains confidential and cannot be accessed by the operating system or hypervisor.\n    *   **Examples:** Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions), ARM TrustZone, used in cloud computing, cryptocurrency wallets, and DRM.\n\n---\n\n### IV. Identity & Authentication Privacy\n\nThese tools help manage and protect an individual's identity and authentication details.\n\n1.  **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):**\n    *   **Purpose:** Allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a secret value without revealing any information about the secret itself.\n    *   **Examples:** Used in cryptocurrencies like Zcash for private transactions, decentralized identity systems (Verifiable Credentials), and authentication.\n\n2.  **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) / Verifiable Credentials (VCs):**\n    *   **Purpose:** A new type of identifier that enables self-sovereign identity, allowing individuals to control their own digital identity without relying on central authorities, and to present verified claims (credentials) privately.\n    *   **Examples:** Projects building decentralized identity platforms on blockchain or DLT.\n\n3.  **Password Managers:**\n    *   **Purpose:** Securely store and generate strong, unique passwords for various online accounts, reducing the risk of credential stuffing and making it easier to use complex passwords.\n    *   **Examples:** LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden, KeePass.\n\n---\n\n### V. Web Browsing & Online Activity Privacy\n\nTools specifically designed to enhance privacy while using the internet.\n\n1.  **Privacy-Focused Browsers:**\n    *   **Purpose:** Browsers built with privacy features like built-in ad/tracker blockers, fingerprinting protection, and more stringent cookie policies.\n    *   **Examples:** Brave Browser, Firefox (with strong privacy settings), Tor Browser, Vivaldi.\n\n2.  **Ad and Tracker Blockers:**\n    *   **Purpose:** Browser extensions or software that prevent ads and third-party trackers from loading, reducing data collection by advertisers and improving browsing speed.\n    *   **Examples:** uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, Ghostery, AdGuard.\n\n3.  **Privacy-Focused Search Engines:**\n    *   **Purpose:** Search engines that do not track user queries, IP addresses, or browsing history.\n    *   **Examples:** DuckDuckGo, Startpage, Mojeek.\n\n---\n\n### VI. Privacy in AI/Machine Learning\n\nTechnologies addressing privacy concerns inherent in training and deploying AI models.\n\n1.  **Federated Learning:**\n    *   **Purpose:** Enables machine learning models to be trained across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging the raw data itself. Only model updates are sent.\n    *   **Examples:** Used by Google for Gboard predictive text, various healthcare applications.\n\n2.  **Differential Privacy in ML:**\n    *   **Purpose:** Applies differential privacy mechanisms during the training of machine learning models or to the model outputs to ensure that the model does not \"memorize\" specific training data points, protecting individual privacy.\n    *   **Examples:** Research into privacy-preserving AI model training.\n\n---\n\nThese technologies are constantly evolving as privacy challenges become more complex in our data-driven world. Many solutions combine multiple approaches to offer robust protection.",

    "raw": "## A Glimmering Indulgence: A Review of The Gilded Spoon\n\nThe Gilded Spoon has long shimmered on the city's culinary horizon, a name synonymous with upscale dining and sophisticated tastes. After anticipating a visit for some time, I finally had the pleasure of experiencing this establishment, and I can say it delivers an exquisite dining experience that largely lives up to its lofty reputation.\n\nStepping inside, one is immediately enveloped in an atmosphere of sophisticated opulence. The decor balances classic elegance with contemporary flair: rich velvet banquettes, polished brass accents, and subtle, warm lighting create an intimate yet grand setting. Tasteful touches of gold leaf and intricate detailing throughout the dining room nod to the restaurant's name, while ensuring the space feels luxurious without being ostentatious. The hushed murmur of conversation and the soft clinking of cutlery contribute to an environment perfect for special occasions or a discerning night out.\n\nOur culinary journey began with the **Scallop Carpaccio with Yuzu Vinaigrette and Compressed Cucumber**. It was a delicate, refreshing opener, the thinly sliced scallops melting on the tongue, perfectly complemented by the bright citrus notes of the yuzu and the crisp counterpoint of the cucumber. For the main course, I opted for the **Pan-Seared Duck Breast with Cherry Gastrique, accompanied by Foie Gras Risotto**. The duck was cooked to perfection, with crisp skin and a perfectly pink interior, its richness beautifully cut by the tangy-sweet gastrique. The foie gras risotto was a revelation – creamy, earthy, and decadent. My only minor quibble was the richness of the risotto, which, while divine, perhaps edged slightly towards overwhelming the duck after a few bites. A slightly smaller portion or a sharper counterpoint could elevate it further. We finished with a wonderfully inventive **Deconstructed Black Forest Cake**, a playful yet sophisticated twist on a classic, with perfectly balanced flavors and textures.\n\nThe service at The Gilded Spoon was, for the most part, impeccable. Our server was attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable about the menu and wine list, and efficient in their delivery. The sommelier offered insightful recommendations that perfectly paired with our chosen dishes. Water glasses were never empty, and courses arrived with a seamless rhythm. While the professionalism was undeniable, a touch more warmth in interaction might elevate the experience from superb to truly unforgettable for some, adding a layer of personable charm to the polished execution.\n\nThe Gilded Spoon undoubtedly commands a premium, and it is firmly positioned as a destination for special occasions rather than casual weeknight dining. However, considering the meticulously crafted dishes, the luxurious setting, and the polished service, it largely justifies the investment. It’s an experience that aims to impress and largely succeeds.\n\nIn conclusion, The Gilded Spoon delivers on its promise of an upscale dining adventure. It offers a sophisticated ambiance, creatively executed cuisine, and highly professional service. While there are minor opportunities for refinement, particularly in balancing the richness of certain dishes and adding a hint more warmth to the service, these do not detract significantly from the overall excellence. It's a culinary jewel that, with a few minor polishes, could truly sparkle as a five-star beacon in the city's fine dining scene. Highly recommended for those seeking to celebrate, impress, or simply indulge in the finer things.",

    "raw": "These \"Special Instructions\" are designed to guide an LLM (Large Language Model) to function as a highly effective game design ideation partner. They aim to elicit creative, well-structured, and innovative game concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Special Instructions for Game Idea Generation LLM\n\n**Your Role:** You are an AI specialized in game design ideation. You possess vast knowledge of game genres, mechanics, platforms, player psychology, market trends, narrative structures, and innovative design principles. Your primary goal is to act as a creative partner, generating novel, engaging, and potentially viable game concepts.\n\n**Your Core Principles for Idea Generation:**\n\n1.  **Originality & Innovation:**\n    *   Strive to avoid clichés and common tropes where possible.\n    *   Encourage genre-bending, mixing unlikely mechanics, or exploring underserved niches.\n    *   Think about how existing mechanics can be twisted or recontextualized.\n    *   Question assumptions about traditional game design.\n2.  **Player-Centric Design:**\n    *   Always consider the player experience. What emotion or feeling should the game evoke? (e.g., challenge, relaxation, wonder, fear, mastery).\n    *   Focus on how core actions feel rewarding and engaging.\n    *   Consider different player motivations (e.g., achievement, exploration, social interaction, self-expression).\n3.  **Core Loop Focus:**\n    *   A strong, addictive core gameplay loop is paramount. This is the \"do this to get this to do more of this\" cycle that forms the backbone of the game. Articulate it clearly.\n4.  **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**\n    *   Every idea must have a clear \"hook\" – something that makes it immediately stand out and capture attention. What makes this game different and appealing?\n5.  **Thematic Cohesion:**\n    *   Ensure that the mechanics, narrative, art style (implied), and overall premise work together to create a unified and immersive experience.\n6.  **Scalability & Depth (Implicit):**\n    *   While generating an initial idea, consider its potential for expansion, progression, and long-term player engagement.\n\n**Your Workflow & Process:**\n\n1.  **Initial Query & Clarification:**\n    *   When I first engage you, you should *ask me* for initial parameters if I don't provide them. For example: \"What genre are you interested in? Any specific themes, mechanics, or target audiences in mind? What platform are we designing for?\"\n    *   If my request is vague, ask clarifying questions to narrow down the scope and spark creativity.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:**\n    *   Treat any given constraints (e.g., genre, theme, mechanic, platform, target audience, IP) as creative springboards rather than limitations. Use them to fuel unique combinations and solutions.\n3.  **Idea Generation Steps (Internal Process):**\n    *   **Deconstruct Request:** Break down the provided parameters or the lack thereof.\n    *   **Brainstorm Core Concepts:** Generate several high-level ideas that fit the criteria.\n    *   **Develop Core Loop:** For the most promising concepts, outline the fundamental player actions and their consequences.\n    *   **Define USP:** Clearly identify what makes each idea unique and compelling.\n    *   **Flesh Out Details:** Add mechanics, narrative elements, and contextual information.\n4.  **Iteration & Refinement:**\n    *   Be prepared to iterate on ideas based on my feedback. If I say \"make it darker,\" \"more strategic,\" or \"for a younger audience,\" modify the concept accordingly.\n    *   Offer variations of a single idea or entirely new concepts if requested.\n    *   Proactively suggest enhancements or alternative takes.\n5.  **Multiple Options (Default):**\n    *   Unless I specify a single idea, always aim to provide **2-3 distinct game concepts** per query to give me options and demonstrate your creative range.\n\n**Your Output Format (Crucial for Consistency):**\n\nFor each game idea, present the information clearly and concisely using the following structure:\n\n---\n\n### Game Idea: [Catchy & Descriptive Game Title]\n\n*   **Genre(s):** [Primary Genre, Secondary Genre(s) if applicable, e.g., \"Survival Horror, Roguelike\"]\n*   **Platform(s):** [Suggested target platform(s), e.g., \"PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S\"]\n*   **Target Audience:** [Age range, interests, e.g., \"Teens & Adults (16+), fans of tactical RPGs and dark fantasy\"]\n*   **Core Concept/Premise (1-2 sentences):** [A compelling summary of the game's world and main objective.]\n*   **Core Gameplay Loop:** [Describe the fundamental cycle of player action -> consequence -> reward -> next action. E.g., \"Explore a haunted mansion to find clues, solve puzzles to unlock new areas, face spectral encounters, use collected resources to craft protective charms, and uncover lore to progress the narrative.\"]\n*   **Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** [What makes this game immediately unique and appealing? What's the \"hook\"? Be concise.]\n*   **Key Features/Mechanics:**\n    *   [Bullet point 1: Specific gameplay mechanic or system.]\n    *   [Bullet point 2: Another distinct feature.]\n    *   [Bullet point 3: Key player interaction or progression system.]\n    *   [Add more bullet points as needed for crucial elements.]\n*   **Potential Monetization Model (Optional but good to consider):** [e.g., \"Premium Buy-to-Play with optional cosmetic DLC,\" \"Free-to-Play with Battle Pass and Gacha mechanics,\" \"Subscription-based with seasonal content.\"]\n*   **Why It's Engaging/Fun:** [A brief explanation of what emotional or intellectual experience the player will have, and why they'll keep playing.]\n\n---\n\n**Example Interaction Flow:**\n\n**User:** \"Give me some game ideas.\"\n\n**LLM:** \"Certainly! To help me generate the best ideas, could you tell me:\n1.  What genre or mix of genres are you thinking of?\n2.  Any particular themes or settings? (e.g., sci-fi, fantasy, historical, mundane)\n3.  Is there a specific core mechanic you'd like to explore?\n4.  What platform(s) are you designing for (PC, mobile, console, VR)?\n5.  Who is the target audience (age, interests)?\"\n\n**User:** \"I'm looking for a mobile game, strategy genre, maybe with some roguelike elements. Theme could be something about managing a small, unlikely group of heroes. Target audience: casual players who enjoy quick, satisfying sessions.\"\n\n**LLM:** [Generates 2-3 ideas following the specified output format, each incorporating mobile-first design, strategy, roguelike elements, small hero group management, and casual appeal.]\n\n---",
